<strong>In the first quarter of 2022, hackers stole $1.2 billion from DeFi protocols through vulnerabilities in smart contracts. Even though there are methods to protect dApps smart contracts from hacks and exploits, the amount of lost and withdrawn funds continues to grow. This undermines user reliance in the whole crypto sphere and especially DeFi, which undergoes the larger half of attacks. How to protect your project from hacking - read in the article.</strong></p>
<h2 id="whatisthedifferencebetweenanexploitandahack"><strong>What is the difference between an exploit and a hack?</strong></h2>
<p>\
The easiest way to understand how these two types of attacks on a smart contract differ is through an example. Let's imagine that there were two robberies on the street. In the first case, the thieves had to find a master key from the lock, and then work hard to crack the safe. And in the second, they simply entered through an open window and found money in a desk drawer. The architecture of smart contracts can be complex, so developers sometimes accidentally leave "open windows" in it for hackers. Finding such vulnerabilities in a smart contract is called an exploit.</p>
<p>\
There are several common causes of smart contract hacks and exploits.</p>
<p>\
<strong>Compromised admin key.</strong> A smart contract claims to be completely decentralized and regulates the relationship between dApps users. But there are a limited number of administrators who have access to privileged functions. If a hacker steals the key, he can take control of the smart contract and steal user funds.</p>
<p>\n <strong>Errors in the smart contract</strong>. As we wrote above, the code is written by people who cannot be insured against errors. There are different types of vulnerabilities in a smart contract - sometimes it's a complex problem that is not easy to detect, and sometimes it's a simple typo in a line of code. But the result of any mistake can be calculated in millions of dollars of stolen funds.</p>
<p>\
<strong>Errors in the smart contract logic</strong>. Some projects simply copy third-party protocols due to a lack of experience and knowledge. Meanwhile, the smart contract includes all the steps and actions that the user takes. And if any part of the logic of these actions is violated, then the funds and user data are at risk.</p>
<h2 id="howtoprotectyourapplicationfromattacksn">How to protect your application from attacks \n</h2>
<p>Most security issues are fairly easy to fix. Below are a few steps that the project team needs to consider when deploying their application or project to DeFi and Web 3.0 \n </p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Hire an experienced development team.</strong> Project security starts with the development of a smart contract. No matter how it seems that there are already enough ready-made smart contacts for deploying applications in blockchain networks, template solutions are not suitable for all projects. In addition, the creation of a smart contract is not the only difficult stage in the roadmap. Developers must be able to test the project properly and know how to work with smart contract audit data.</li>
</ol>
<p>\</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Pass unit testing.</strong> The essence of the blockchain is that its data is immutable - if errors are found after the application is launched, they cannot be corrected. Therefore, it is necessary to test the functionality of the smart contract in advance in a test network.</li>
</ol>
<p>\</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Pass an independent audit of the smart contract.</strong> It usually helps to identify errors in the code, find and assess potential vulnerabilities, and test interface logic. If the project is complex and involves large amounts of blocked user funds, it is advisable to undergo an audit in several accredited firms at once. Here are some auditors: Certik, Blaize, Hacken, SlowMist, and Chainsulting.</li>
</ol>
<p>\</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Ensure the security of admin keys.</strong> You must carefully consider the storage of private keys and not trust them to third parties. It would be better to introduce multi-factor authentication - access to the smart contract could be obtained using not one, but several keys. In this case, even if one of them is compromised, attackers will not be able to access the functions of the smart contract.</li>
</ol>
<p>\</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Ask help from the community or white hat hackers.</strong> This is an optional step, but in some cases, a simple audit may not be enough. For example, for new second-layer networks or multi-billion dollar DeFi protocols. The introduction of rewards for found bugs and vulnerabilities might solve several problems at once - it will improve the user experience in the application and help prevent potential hacking of the protocol.</li>
</ol>
<p>\
Many of the tips above may seem obvious, but as crypto crime statistics show, not all protocols follow them. Exploits and hacks of smart contracts ultimately lead to loss of reputation, reduce industry credibility and attract the attention of regulators. Therefore, it is especially important to monitor the security measures of your project.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>\
Any website needs to be protected. Auditing the website's or web application's information security is crucial. So you will provide reliable protection of the website, keep the confidentiality of data, and do not allow hackers to penetrate your web application. As a result, the website will be protected from any attacks.</p>
<p>\
Many cybersecurity agencies with cybersecurity experts can do a comprehensive website audit and create comprehensive cyber protection for any web application. By addressing them, you will qualitatively choose the best methods of protection and will protect your website from hacking and attack.</p>
<p>\
Cybersecurity experts will:</p>
<p>\</p>
<ul>
<li>Audit of website security at the moment</li>
<li>Find vulnerabilities and create strong technical protection for them</li>
<li>Choose and create a strong method of protection based on the technical parameters of the web application</li>
</ul>
<p>\
Your website is the face of the company. The attitude of partners and clients to your company depends on it. If you are serious about your business and want to secure it, turn to the cybersecurity team. As a result, you will get comprehensive support on all technical issues related to website or web application security.</p>
<p>\
What threats can your website or web application be exposed to? Let`s discuss.</p>
<h2 id="webshellsbackdoorsuploaders">Web shells, backdoors, uploaders</h2>
<p>\
 <img src="https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/ibiIhGcvjcMB9ly4daDKGWgs0wq1-2022-10-05T09:00:02.313Z-cl8vefoi9000001s6geaq9gso" alt="" /></p>
<p>It is sufficient to upload a so-called web shell (the primary tool of a hacker) to a hosting service to control a website or web application.</p>
<p>\
A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_shell">web shell</a> is a script with the capabilities of a file manager, database manager, and tunneling. Hackers can edit files on the hosting, upload new ones, delete the current ones, change their attributes, perform searches, read the contents of the database, execute arbitrary SQL commands, forward a connection to the local database from a remote server, etc. Web shell displays the current server configuration, has an interface for receiving and automatically executing commands, and much more. It gives the attacker full control over the website and the entire hosting account.</p>
<p>\
 <img src="https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/ibiIhGcvjcMB9ly4daDKGWgs0wq1-2022-10-05T09:00:02.474Z-cl8vefokr000101s67sgjgb9d" alt="" /></p>
<p>A backdoor is a small hacker script or code fragment injected into one of the CMS scripts. The primary purpose of a backdoor is to provide a hacker with a backdoor to run arbitrary code or to download a web shell and gain control of the compromised website or web application.</p>
<p>\
 <img src="https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/ibiIhGcvjcMB9ly4daDKGWgs0wq1-2022-10-05T09:00:02.476Z-cl8vefoks000201s67do5enwd" alt="" /></p>
<p>The uploader is another backdoor variant that allows a hacker to upload an arbitrary file to a server. This cybersecurity threat is quite tricky to detect because it is a small script with code found in legitimate scripts to upload files to the server (for example, in the upload forms of CMS). That is why an inexperienced cybersecurity expert may not attach importance to the "uploader" file even if he detects it.</p>
<h2 id="differentwebsitevulnerabilitiesthatareknowntothepublic">Different website vulnerabilities that are known to the public</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/ibiIhGcvjcMB9ly4daDKGWgs0wq1-2022-10-05T09:00:02.478Z-cl8vefoku000301s636atenrq" alt="" /></p>
<p>Most dynamic websites based on PHP, ASP, and CGI scripts are vulnerable. Suppose a website uses a popular CMS that has not been updated for a long time or was written by an inexperienced web developer. In that case, it is most likely that this website has been (or will be soon) jeopardized by a massive attack via known vulnerabilities. It even does not matter how many people visit the website or how popular it is.</p>
<p>\
To reduce the likelihood of hacking, CMS should be updated as soon as possible to the latest version available. You need to install all existing security patches and, preferably, perform the procedure CMS hardening, which would prohibit unauthorized changes to the site.</p>
<h2 id="mobileorsearchredirect">Mobile or search redirect</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/ibiIhGcvjcMB9ly4daDKGWgs0wq1-2022-10-05T09:00:02.569Z-cl8vefone000401s6azltbp0t" alt="" /></p>
<p>A redirect is an unauthorized redirect to a third-party resource. Example: a visitor opens an infected website in a mobile browser and is redirected to an adult-only resource or a WAP-portal offering to subscribe to media content for an SMS.</p>
<p>\
A mobile redirect may be caused by a code fragment inserted into a template, script, or website database by an intruder. To accurately check your websites for mobile redirects, in most cases, it is sufficient to connect your mobile device to the mobile Internet via 3G/LTE network and open the website in a mobile browser.</p>
<h2 id="viruscodeoradvertising">Virus code or advertising</h2>
<p>Hackers can place code on the client's website pages, occasionally displaying pop-up banners, opening pop-ups when clicking on links, inserting teaser blocks, or contextual advertisements. Due to skillful targeting, which the hacker sets up, the website owner may not notice unauthorized advertising for a long time (for example, it may be shown only to Kyiv citizens or those who open the website from a mobile device). And the hacker will make a long time by such parasitism on someone else's website.</p>
<h2 id="additionalforgottenadministrativeaccountsabandonedftpaccountsandignoranceofcontractors">Additional (forgotten) administrative accounts, abandoned FTP accounts, and ignorance of contractors</h2>
<p>The most common mistake a website owner makes is to entrust a freelancer with all access to a website and forget about it. Only a small percentage of ordinary content managers and web developers know the safety precautions when working with the website. Therefore, third-party maintenance (content managers, administrators, web admins) often cause websites to be compromised.</p>
<p>\
Why does this happen? It's simple: hired professionals have at their disposal "the keys to the apartment where the money lies," but due to a lack of awareness of security and site protection, these keys are literally hiding under the doormat by the front door. Hackers know this and are actively taking advantage of it.</p>
<p>\
Let's list the most typical mistakes made by specialists and website owners leading to websites being compromised or infected:</p>
<p>\</p>
<ul>
<li>An FTP webmaster's computer may be infected with a Trojan that intercepts FTP traffic and steals passwords or with a spyware program that extracts passwords from the FTP client. As a result, the hacker gets the password, and later a bot infiltrates the hosting site and infects the files with malicious code.</li>
<li>A web developer can access the Internet through open networks (in cafes, parks, subways, and other open WI-FI points) without using a VPN, which compromises access to the hosting and administration panel of the site. As a result, the correspondence with the site owner containing confidential information is intercepted by the intruder (now, any schoolboy can do it using the traffic sniffer in promiscuous mode or specialized applications like Intercepter-NG).</li>
<li>The site owner creates one account for all contractors, often with full privileges (e.g., root access to the server). With this approach, finding the culprit in case of incidents or problems with the site (hacking, infection, and data destruction) is virtually impossible.</li>
</ul>
<p>\
For the stable and smooth operation of the website or web application, it is vital to ensure its security. Then you won't have to risk relationships with customers and users. Now you understand why you should be careful with the security of your website or web application.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>\
Getting paid what you are worth can be a challenge, especially if you donâ€™t know your worth. Before digging into how to get paid more, you should understand your&nbsp;<a href="https://hackernoon.com/what-does-total-compensation-really-mean">compensation</a>&nbsp;(or prospective compensation if you are looking at a job offer). Once youâ€™ve got a handle on the components of your total compensation, itâ€™s time to evaluate what you are currently getting or being offered, look at your accomplishments, and prepare yourself to negotiate compensation.</p>
<p>\</p>
<h2 id="researchcompensationforyourposition">Research compensation for your position</h2>
<p>The very first thing to do is to find out if the compensation in question is fair or not. If you can get reliable information on what other people in your role at your company are getting paid, then you have a great starting point. There are many ways to research salary, but especially for tech salaries, there arenâ€™t any as good as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.teamblind.com/">Blind</a>. Blind verifies that users are employed by their employer for real but is otherwise completely anonymous, allowing users to be open to discussing difficult topics like compensation. In fact, Blind users encourage discussion and are very open to giving others advice and passing on tips about what is expected and how to do better. So go onto&nbsp;Blind, use its&nbsp;Total Compensation tool&nbsp;and get detailed information about salaries at target companies.</p>
<p>\
Of course, also use other salary tools and look into different ways to get information, including the job posting and careers pages of the companies you are interested in. See if you have any connections to people at the company in question (again, Blind is a great way to do this) and reach out to see if they will help.</p>
<p>\</p>
<h2 id="askforhelpandadvice">Ask for help and advice</h2>
<p>The next step to get even more detailed information and advice is also to use Blind, but this time in the discussion section. Go search for information about the positions and companies you are interested in and read the resulting&nbsp;discussions, including the comments. Be skeptical about everything you read because it is social media, and not everyone is helpful. But you should get a picture of what you might expect. Finally, go into the Blind discussion forums and post any questions. You might be surprised at the help you get from other Blind users.</p>
<p>\</p>
<h2 id="preparealistofaccomplishments">Prepare a list of accomplishments</h2>
<p>Now that you have some realistic idea of what the position you are in or looking to gain is worth, itâ€™s time to make a case for why you should get more. There are two possibilities: you are already underpaid or have discovered your offer is low. Alternatively, you found out that the pay is reasonable, but you still think you should get more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>\
Make a list of your accomplishments and compare them to the goals and objectives for the position, whether it is one you are being offered or your current position and you think you deserve a raise. Be as detailed and specific as possible, and always include numbers and data. Rather than saying, â€œI made commits to the XXX project that made users happier,â€ say, â€œI made N commits during the last quarter to the XXX project resulting in a 33% increase in usage of the features involved.â€</p>
<p>\
Build a case, using these accomplishments, for why you deserve extra consideration. Go through every point and provide as much concrete evidence as you can. Think through any objections someone might make and how to counter them. Then go through the â€˜softâ€™ skills for your role around teamwork and communication and other factors that go into success. Do the same thing and quantify whenever you can. Be prepared to present or discuss both these lists in any compensation discussion.</p>
<p>\</p>
<h2 id="thinkaboutwhatyouwanttoaskfor">Think about what you want to ask for</h2>
<p>You have several avenues of attack to get better compensation. You can ask for more across the board and focus on one component, such as salary, stock, or bonus. Be ready to pivot to another area if you are countered with a statement that the company canâ€™t possibly give you more stock, for example. Simply ask if there is room for movement in the bonus or salary, etc. If you have a specific goal in mind, ask for a little more, but be prepared to switch to your particular goal.</p>
<p>\</p>
<h2 id="joboffernegotiation">Job offer negotiation</h2>
<p>If you receive a <a href="https://hackernoon.com/how-the-job-market-is-being-misrepresented-to-you">job offer</a> and want to see if it can be pushed a little higher, perform all the steps outlined above but also be aware that many companies are expecting you to ask for more. So make your case and ask for what you think is reasonable, or 10% more than you were offered if you canâ€™t get a point of comparison.&nbsp;</p>
<p>\
The very worst thing that can happen is that the company says no. The second worst thing that can happen is that they get upset and withdraw the offer â€“ at least, in that case, you have learned that they arenâ€™t serious about compensation, and you can continue your search for a better position.&nbsp;</p>
<p>\
But most likely, they will come back with an increased offer. If they match what you asked for, then you are done. Asking for more a second time is a sure way to start off badly. If they come back with an offer that is in between but acceptable, do the same, and accept gratefully. If the counteroffer is still not good enough for you, you must decide whether to tell them what is acceptable or walk away. At this point, unless you are firm about what you need and wonâ€™t take less, it is often a good idea to just decide yes or no rather than go back a second time.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>\
Ever wondered how to take input from the user to calculate and display the multiplication table of the given number from 1 to 10?</p>
<p>\
Let's write a program in Java to perform this task.</p>
<p>\
This program can be solved by 2 methods, first one is long and time-consuming whereas the second one needs fewer lines of code but it is not beginners friendly.</p>
<p>\
Let us first start with the tough one then we will move towards the easy method.</p>
<p>\
As always, start with the importing statement.</p>
<p>\</p>
<pre><code class="java language-java">import java.util.Scanner;
</code></pre>
<p>\
Public class and public static.</p>
<p>\</p>
<pre><code class="java language-java">public  class  MultiplicationTable {
public  static  void  main(String[] args) {
</code></pre>

<p>\
I guess you have noticed it the first number is getting printed two times. I don't know why, probably there is something wrong with the compiler. I have commented out <code>System.out.println(n);</code> so that the first number does not get printed two times,</p>
<p>Now, let's make the program with the second and easier method.</p>
<p>\
Note: The second method requires basic knowledge of the while loop. it is recommended to learn about the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_loop_while.asp">while loop</a> before proceeding.</p>
<p>\
Everything is the same I am just modifying the 10 <code>System.out.println</code>.</p>
<p>\</p>
<pre><code class="java language-java">    while (i&lt;=10) {
    i++; // i++ is below because the first number is getting print 2 times
    System.out.println(n*i);
}
</code></pre>
<p>\
Yeah, that's it. While loop makes life so easy.</p>
<p>\
You may also have noticed that usually the increment <code>i++</code> is at the end of the program then why it is above the printing statement?</p>
<p>\
The reason is that the first number which is the number itself. is getting printed 2 times so to avoid that, the upgradation statement before the printing statement.</p>

Close the exit; we depart at once.&quot;</strong></div><div class="paragraph">The Forgotten Planet was not always so named. The name that it once bore had been, as every child knows, stricken from the records, actual and mental, of the Universe. It is well that evil should not be remembered. But in order that this history may be clear in the centuries to come, my record should go back to beginnings.</div><div class="paragraph">So far as the Universe is concerned, the history of the Forgotten Planet begins with the visit of the first craft ever to span the space between the<a></a>Â worlds: the crude, adventuresomeÂ Edorn, whose name, as well as the names of the nine Zenians who manned her, occupy the highest places in the roll of honor of the Universe.</div><div class="paragraph">Ame Baove, the commander and historian of theÂ Edorn, made but brief comment on his stop at the Forgotten Planet. I shall record it in full:</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;We came to rest upon the surface of this, the fourth of the planets visited during the first trip of theÂ Edorn, eighteen spaces before the height of the sun. We found ourselves surrounded immediately by vast numbers of creatures very different from ourselves, and from their expressions and gestures, we gathered that they were both curious and unfriendly.</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;Careful analysis of the atmosphere proved it to be sufficiently similar to our own to make it possible for us to again stretch our legs outside the rather cramped quarters of theÂ Edorn, and tread the soil of still another world.</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;No sooner had we emerged, however, than we were angrily beset by the people of this unfriendly planet, and rather than do them injury, we retired immediately, and concluded our brief observations through our ports.</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;The topography of this planet is similar to our own, save that there are no mountains, and the flora is highly colored almost without exception, and apparently quite largely parasitical in nature. The people are rather short in stature, with hairless heads and high foreheads. Instead of being round or oval, however, the heads of these people rise to a rounded ridge which runs back from a point between and just above the eyes, nearly to the nape of the neck behind. They give evidence of a fair order of intelligence, but are suspicious and unfriendly. From the number and size of the cities we saw, this planet is evidently thickly populated.</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;We left about sixteen spaces before the height of the sun, and continued towards the fifth and last planet before our return to Zenia.&quot;</div><div class="paragraph">THISÂ report, quite naturally, caused other explorers in space to hesitate. There were so many friendly, eager worlds to visit, during the years that relations between the planets were being established, that an unfriendly people were ignored.</div><div class="paragraph">However, from time to time, as space-ships became perfected and more common, parties from many of the more progressive planets did call. Each of them met with the same hostile reception, and at last, shortly after the second War of the Planets, the victorious Alliance sent a fleet of the small but terrible Deuber Spheres, convoyed by four of the largest of the disintegrator ray-ships, to subjugate the Forgotten Planet.</div><div class="paragraph">Five great cities were destroyed, and the Control City, the seat of the government, was menaced before the surly inhabitants conceded allegiance to the Alliance. Parties of scientists, fabricators, and workmen were then landed, and a dictator was appointed.</div><div class="paragraph">From all the worlds of the Alliance, instruments and equipment were brought to the Forgotten Planet. A great educational system was planned and executed, the benign and kindly influence of the Alliance made every effort to improve the conditions existing on the Forgotten Planet, and to win the friendship and allegiance of these people.</div><div class="paragraph">For two centuries the work went on. Two centuries of bloodshed, strife, hate and disturbance. No where else within the known Universe was there ill feeling. The second awful War of the Planets had at last succeeded in teaching the lesson of peace.</div><div class="paragraph">Two centuries of effortâ€”wasted effort. It was near the end of the second<a></a>Â century that my own story begins.</div><div class="paragraph">Commander at that time of the super-cruiserÂ Tamon, a Special Patrol ship of the Alliance, I was not at all surprised to receive orders from the Central Council to report at emergency speed. Special Patrol work in those days, before the advent of the present de-centralized system, was a succession of false starts, hurried recalls, and urgent, emergency orders.</div><div class="paragraph">I OBEYEDÂ at once. In the Special Patrol service, there is no questioning orders. The planet Earth, from which I sprang, is and always has been proud of the fact that from the very beginning, her men have been picked to command the ships of the Special Patrol. No matter how dangerous, how forlorn and hopeless the mission given to a commander of a Special Patrol ship, history has never recorded that any commander has ever hesitated. That is why our uniform of blue and silver commands the respect that it does even in this day and age of softening and decadence, when menâ€”but again an old man digresses. And perhaps it is not for me to judge.</div><div class="paragraph">I pointed the blunt nose of theÂ TamonÂ at Zenia, seat of the Central Council, and in four hours, Earth time, the great craft swept over the gleaming city of the Central Council and settled swiftly to the court before the mighty, columned Hall of the Planets.</div><div class="paragraph">Four pages of the Council, in their white and scarlet livery, met me and conducted me instantly to a little anteroom behind the great council chamber.</div><div class="paragraph">There were three men awaiting me there; three men whose faces, at that time, were familiar to every person in the known Universe.</div><div class="paragraph">Kellen, the oldest of the three, and the spokesman, rose as I entered the room. The others did likewise, as the pages closed the heavy doors behind me.</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;You are prompt, and that is good,&quot; thought Kellen. &quot;I welcome you. Remove now thy menore.&quot;</div><div class="paragraph">I glanced up at him swiftly. This must surely be an important matter, that I was asked to remove my menore band.</div><div class="paragraph">It will, of course, be understood that at that time we had but a bulky and clumsy instrument to enable us to convey and receive thought; a device consisting of a heavy band of metal, in which were imbedded the necessary instruments and a tiny atomic energy generator, the whole being worn as a circlet or crown upon the head.</div><div class="paragraph">Wonderingly, I removed my menore, placed it upon the long, dark table around which the three men were standing, and bowed. Each of the three, in turn, lifted their gleaming circlets from their heads, and placed them likewise upon the table before them.</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;</div><div class="paragraph">YOUÂ wonder,&quot; said Kellen, speaking of course, in the soft and liquid universal language, which is, I understand, still disseminated in our schools, as it should be. &quot;I shall explain as quickly and as briefly as possible.</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;We have called you here on a dangerous mission. A mission that will require tact and quickness of mind as well as bravery. We have selected you, have called you, because we are agreed that you possess the qualities required. Is it not so?&quot; He glanced at his two companions, and they nodded gravely, solemnly, without speaking.</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;You are a young man, John Hanson,&quot; continued Kellen, &quot;but your record in your service is one of which you can be proud. We trust youâ€”with knowledge that is so secret, so precious, that we must revert to speech in order to convey it; we dare not trust it, even in this protected and guarded place, to the menore&#x27;s quicker but less discreet communication.&quot;</div><div class="paragraph">He paused for a moment, frowning thoughtfully as though dreading to begin. I waited silently, and at last he spoke again.<a></a></div><div class="paragraph">&quot;There is a world&quot;â€”and he named a name which I shall not repeat, the name of the Forgotten Planetâ€”&quot;that is a festering sore upon the body of the Universe. As you know, for two centuries we have tried to pass on to these people an understanding of peace and friendship. I believe that nothing has been left undone. The Council and the forces behind it have done everything within their power. And nowâ€”&quot;</div><div class="paragraph">He stopped again, and there was an expression of deepest pain written upon his wise and kindly face. The pause was for but an instant.</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;And now,&quot; he went on firmly, &quot;it is at an end. Our work has been undone. Two centuries of effortâ€”undone. They have risen in revolt, they have killed all those sent by the Alliance of which this Council is the governing body and the mouthpiece, and they have sent us an ultimatumâ€”a threat of war!&quot;</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;What?&quot;</div><div class="paragraph">KELLENÂ nodded his magnificent old head gravely.</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;I do not wonder that you start,&quot; he said heavily. &quot;War! It must not be. It cannot be! And yet, war is what they threaten.&quot;</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;But, sir!&quot; I put in eagerly. I was young and rash in those days. &quot;Who are they, to make war against a united Universe?&quot;</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;I have visited your planet, Earth,&quot; said Kellen, smiling very faintly. &quot;You have a tiny winged insect you callÂ bee. Is it not so?&quot;</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;Yes.&quot;</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;The bee is a tiny thing, of little strength. A man, a little child, might crush one to death between a thumb and finger. But the bee may sting before he is crushed, and the sting may linger on for days, a painful and unpleasant thing. Is that not so?&quot;</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;I see, sir,&quot; I replied, somewhat abashed before the tolerant, kindly wisdom of this great man. &quot;They cannot hope to wage successful war, but they may bring much suffering to others.&quot;</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;Much suffering,&quot; nodded Kellen, still gently smiling. &quot;And we are determined that this thing shall not be. Not&quot;â€”and his face grew gray with a terrible and bitter resolveâ€”&quot;not if we have to bring to bear upon that dark and unwilling world the disintegrating rays of every ship of the Alliance, so that the very shell of the planet shall disappear, and no life ever again shall move upon its surface.</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;But this,&quot; and he seemed to shudder at the thought, &quot;is a terrible and a ruthless thing to even contemplate. We must first try once again to point out to them the folly of their ways. It is with this mission that we would burden you, John Hanson.&quot;</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;ITÂ is no burden, but an honor, sir,&quot; I said quietly.</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;Youth! Youth!&quot; Kellen chided me gently. &quot;Foolish, yet rather glorious. Let me tell you the rest, and then we shall ask for your reply again.</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;The news came to us by a small scout ship attached to that unhappy world. It barely made the journey to Jaron, the nearest planet, and crashed so badly, from lack of power, that all save one man were killed.</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;He, luckily, tore off his menore, and insisted in speech that he be brought here. He was obeyed, and, in a dying condition, was brought to this very chamber.&quot; Kellen glanced swiftly, sadly, around the room, as though he could still visualize that scene.</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;Every agent of the Alliance upon that hateful planet was set upon and killed, following the working out of some gigantic and perfectly executed planâ€”all save the crew of this one tiny scout ship, which was spared to act as a messenger.</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;&#x27;Tell your great Council,&#x27; was the message these people sent to us, &#x27;that here is rebellion. We do not want, nor will we tolerate, your peace. We have learned now that upon other worlds than ours there are great riches. These we shall take. If there is re<a></a>sistance, we have a new and a terrible death to deal. A death that your great scientists will be helpless against; a horrible and irresistable death that will make desolate and devoid of intelligent life any world where we are forced to sow the seeds of ultimate disaster.</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;&#x27;We are not yet ready. If we were, we would not move, for we prefer that your Council have time to think about what is surely to come. If you doubt that we have the power to do what we have threatened to do, send one ship, commanded by a man whose word you will trust, and we will prove to him that these are no empty words.&#x27;&quot;</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;</div><div class="paragraph">THAT, as nearly as I can remember it,&quot; concluded Kellen, &quot;is the message. The man who brought it died almost before he had finished.</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;That is the message. You are the man we have picked to accept their challenge. Remember, though, that there are but the four of us in this room. There are but four of us who know these things. If you for any reason do not wish to accept this mission, there will be none to judge you, least of all, any one of us, who know best of all the perils.&quot;</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;You say, sir,&quot; I said quietly, although my heart was pounding in my throat, and roaring in my ears, &quot;that there would be none to judge me.</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;Sir, there would be myself. There could be no more merciless judge. I am honored that I have been selected for this task, and I accept the responsibility willingly, gladly. When is it your wish that we should start?&quot;</div><div class="paragraph">The three presiding members of the Council glanced at each other, faintly smiling, as though they would say, as Kellen had said a short time before: &quot;Youth! Youth!&quot; Yet I believe they were glad and somewhat proud that I had replied as I did.</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;You may start,&quot; said Kellen, &quot;as soon as you can complete the necessary preparations. Detailed instructions will be given you later.&quot;</div><div class="paragraph">He bowed to me, and the others did likewise. Then Kellen picked up his menore and adjusted it.</div><div class="paragraph">The interview was over.</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;</div><div class="paragraph">WHATÂ do you make it?&quot; I asked the observer. He glanced up from his instrument.</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;Jaron, sir. Three degrees to port; elevation between five and six degrees. Approximate only, of course, sir.&quot;</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;Good enough. Please ask Mr. Barry to hold to his present course. We shall not stop at Jaron.&quot;</div><div class="paragraph">The observer glanced at me curiously, but he was too well disciplined to hesitate or ask questions.</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;Yes, sir!&quot; he said crisply, and spoke into the microphone beside him.</div><div class="paragraph">None of us wore menores when on duty, for several reasons. Our instruments were not nearly as perfect as those in use to-day, and verbal orders were clearer and carried more authority than mental instructions. The delicate and powerful electrical and atomic mechanism of our ship interfered with the functioning of the menores, and at that time the old habit of speech was far more firmly entrenched, due to hereditary influence, than it is now.</div><div class="paragraph">I nodded to the man, and made my way to my own quarters. I wished most heartily that I could talk over my plans with someone, but this had been expressly forbidden.</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;I realize that you trust your men, and more particularly your officers,&quot; Kellen had told me during the course of his parting conversation with me. &quot;I trust them alsoâ€”yet we must remember that the peace of mind of the Universe is concerned. If news, even a rumor, of this threatened disaster should become known, it is impossible to predict the disturbance it might create.</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;Say nothing to anyone. It is your problem. You alone should leave the ship when you land; you alone shall hear or see the evidence they have to present, and you alone shall bring word of it to us. That is the wish of the Council.&quot;<a></a></div><div class="paragraph">&quot;Then it is my wish,&quot; I had said, and so it had been settled.</div><div class="paragraph">AFT, in the crew&#x27;s quarters, a gong sounded sharply: the signal for changing watches, and the beginning of a sleep period. I glanced at the remote control dials that glowed behind their glass panel on one side of my room. From the registered attraction of Jaron, at our present speed, we should be passing her within, according to Earth time, about two hours. That meant that their outer patrols might be seeking our business, and I touched Barry&#x27;s attention button, and spoke into the microphone beside my bunk.</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;Mr. Barry? I am turning in for a little sleep. Before you turn over the watch to Eitel, will you see that the nose rays are set for the Special Patrol code signal for this enar. We shall be close to Jaron shortly.&quot;</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;Yes, sir! Any other orders?&quot;</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;No. Keep her on her present course. I shall take the watch from Mr. Eitel.&quot;</div><div class="paragraph">Since there have been changes since those days, and will undoubtedly be others in the future, it might be well to make clear, in a document such is this, that at this period, all ships of the Special Patrol Service identified themselves by means of invisible rays flashed in certain sequences, from the two nose, or forward, projectors. These code signals were changed every enar, a period of time arbitrarily set by the Council; about eighteen days, as time is measured on the Earth, and divided into ten periods, as at present, known as enarens. These were further divided into enaros, thus giving us a time-reckoning system for use in space, corresponding roughly to the months, days and hours of the Earth.</div><div class="paragraph">I retired, but not to sleep. Sleep would not come. I knew, of course, that if curious outer patrol ships from Jaron did investigate us, they would be able to detect our invisible ray code signal, and thus satisfy themselves that we were on the Council&#x27;s business. There would be no difficulty on that score. But what I should do after landing upon the rebellious sphere, I had not the slightest idea.</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;BEÂ stern, indifferent to their threats,&quot; Kellen, had counseled me, &quot;but do everything within your power to make them see the folly of their attitude. Do not threaten them, for they are a surly people and you might precipitate matters. Swallow your pride if you must; remember that yours is a gigantic responsibility, and upon the information you bring us may depend the salvation of millions. I am convinced that they are notâ€”you have a word in your language that fits exactly. Not pretending ... what is the word?&quot;</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;Bluffing?&quot; I had supplied in English, smiling.</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;Right! Bluffing. It is a very descriptive word. I am sure they are not bluffing.&quot;</div><div class="paragraph">I was sure of it also. They knew the power of the Alliance; they had been made to feel it more than once. A bluff would have been a foolish thing, and these people were not fools. In some lines of research they were extraordinarily brilliant.</div><div class="paragraph">But what could their new, terrible weapon be? Rays we had; at least half a dozen rays of destruction; the terrible dehydrating ray of the Deuber Spheres, the disintegrating ray that dated back before Ame Baove and his first voyage into space, the concentrated ultra-violet ray that struck men down in fiery torment.... No, it could hardly be a new ray that was their boasted weapon.</div><div class="paragraph">What, then? Electricity had even then been exhausted of its possibilities. Atomic energy had been released, harnessed, and directed. Yet it would take fabulous time and expense to make these machines of destruction do what they claimed they would do.</div><div class="paragraph">Still pondering the problem, I did fall at last into a fitful travesty of sleep.</div><div class="paragraph">I WASÂ glad when the soft clamor of the bell aft announced the next change of watch. I rose, cleared the cobwebs from my brain with an icy shower, and made my way directly to the navigating room.</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;Everything tidy, sir,&quot; said Eitel, my second officer, and a Zenian. He was thin and very dark, like all Zenians, and had the high, effeminate voice of that people. But he was cool and fearless and had the uncanny cerebration of his kind; I trusted him as completely as I trusted Barry, my first officer, who, like myself, was a native of Earth. &quot;Will you take over?&quot;</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;Yes,&quot; I nodded, glancing at the twin charts beneath the ground glass top of the control table. &quot;Get what sleep you can the next few enaros. Presently I shall want every man on duty and at his station.&quot;</div><div class="paragraph">He glanced at me curiously, as the observer had done, but saluted and left with only a brief, &quot;Yes, sir!&quot; I returned the salute and turned my attention again to the charts.</div><div class="paragraph">The navigating room of an interplanetary ship is without doubt unfamiliar ground to most, so it might be well for me to say that such ships have, for the most part, twin charts, showing progress in two dimensions; to use land terms, lateral and vertical. These charts are really no more than large sheets of ground glass, ruled in both directions with fine black lines, representing all relatively close heavenly bodies by green lights of varying sizes. The ship itself is represented by a red spark and the whole is, of course, entirely automatic in action, the instruments comprising the chart being operated by super-radio reflexes.</div><div class="paragraph">JARON, the charts showed me at a glance, was now far behind. Almost directly aboveâ€”it is necessary to resort to these unscientific terms to make my meaning clearâ€”was the tiny world Elon, home of the friendly but impossibly dull winged people, the only ones in the known Universe. I was there but once, and found them almost laughably like our common dragon-flies on Earth; dragon-flies that grow some seven feet long, and with gauzy wings of amazing strength.</div><div class="paragraph">Directly ahead, on both charts, was a brilliantly glowing sphere of greenâ€”our destination. I made some rapid mental calculations, studying the few fine black lines between the red spark that was our ship, and the nearest edge of the great green sphere. I glanced at our speed indicator and the attraction meter. The little red slide that moved around the rim of the attraction meter was squarely at the top, showing that the attraction was from straight ahead; the great black hand was nearly a third of the way around the face.</div><div class="paragraph">We were very close; two hours would bring us into the atmospheric envelope. In less than two hours and a half, we would be in the Control City of what is now called the Forgotten Planet!</div><div class="paragraph">I glanced forward, through the thick glass partitions, into the operating room. Three men stood there, watching intently; they too, were wondering why we visited the unfriendly world.</div><div class="paragraph">The planet itself loomed up straight ahead, a great half-circle, its curved rim sharp and bright against the empty blackness of space; the chord ragged and blurred. In two hours ... I turned away and began a restless pacing.</div><div class="paragraph">ANÂ hour went by; an hour and a half. I pressed the attention button to the operating room, and gave orders to reduce our speed by half. We were very close to the outer fringe of the atmospheric envelope. Then, keeping my eye on the big surface-temperature gauge, with its stubby red hand, I resumed my nervous pacing.</div><div class="paragraph">Slowly the thick red hand of the surface-temperature gauge began to move; slowly, and then more rapidly, until the eyes could catch its creeping.</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;Reduce to atmospheric speed,&quot; I ordered curtly, and glanced down<a></a>Â through a side port at one end of the long navigating room.</div><div class="paragraph">We were, at the moment, directly above the twilight belt. To my right, as I looked down, I could see a portion of the glistening antarctic ice cap. Here and there were the great flat lakes, almost seas, of the planet.</div><div class="paragraph">Our geographies of the Universe to-day do not show the topography of the Forgotten Planet: I might say, therefore, that the entire sphere was land area, with numerous great lakes embedded in its surface, together with many broad, very crooked rivers. As Ame Baove had reported, there were no mountains, and no high land.</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;Altitude constant,&quot; I ordered. &quot;Port three degrees. Stand by for further orders.&quot;</div><div class="paragraph">The earth seemed to whirl slowly beneath us. Great cities drifted astern, and I compared the scene below me with the great maps I took from our chart-case. The Control City should be just beyond the visible rim; well in the daylight area.</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;Port five degrees,&quot; I said, and pressed the attention button to Barry&#x27;s quarters.</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;Mr. Barry, please call all men to quarters, including the off-duty watch, and then report to the navigating room. Mr. Eitel will be under my direct orders. We shall descend within the next few minutes.&quot;</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;Very well, sir.&quot;</div><div class="paragraph">I pressed the attention button to Eitel&#x27;s room.</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;Mr. Eitel, please pick ten of your best men and have them report at the forward exit. Await me, with the men, at that place. I shall be with you as soon as I turn the command over to Mr. Barry. We are descending immediately.&quot;</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;Right, sir!&quot; said Eitel.</div><div class="paragraph">I TURNEDÂ from the microphone to find that Barry had just entered the navigating room.</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;We will descend into the Great Court of the Control City, Mr. Barry,&quot; I said. &quot;I have a mission here. I am sorry, but these are the only instructions I can leave you.</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;I do not know how long I shall be gone from the ship, but if I do not return within three hours, depart without me, and report directly to Kellen of the Council. To him, and no other. Tell him, verbally, what took place. Should there be any concerted action against theÂ Tamon, use your own judgment as to the action to be taken, remembering that the safety of the ship and its crew, and the report of the Council, are infinitely more important than my personal welfare. Is that clear?&quot;</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;Yes, sir. Too damned clear.&quot;</div><div class="paragraph">I smiled and shook my head.</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;Don&#x27;t worry,&quot; I said lightly. &quot;I&#x27;ll be back well within the appointed time.&quot;</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;I hope so. But there&#x27;s something wrong as hell here. I&#x27;m talking now as man to man; not to my commanding officer. I&#x27;ve been watching below, and I have seen at least two spots where large numbers of our ships have been destroyed. The remaining ships bear their own damned emblem where the crest of the Alliance should beâ€”and was. What does it mean?&quot;</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;It means,&quot; I said slowly, &quot;that I shall have to rely upon every man and officer to forget himself and myself, and obey orders without hesitation and without flinching. The orders are not mine, but direct from the Council itself.&quot; I held out my hand to himâ€”an ancient Earth gesture of greeting, good-will and farewellâ€”and he shook it vigorously.</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;God go with you,&quot; he said softly, and with a little nod of thanks I turned and quickly left the room.</div><div class="paragraph">EITEL, with his ten men, were waiting for me at the forward exit. The men fell back a few paces and came to attention; Eitel saluted smartly.</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;We are ready, sir. What are your orders?&quot;<a></a></div><div class="paragraph">&quot;You are to guard this opening. Under no circumstances is anyone to enter save myself. I shall be gone not longer than three hours; if I am not back within that time, Mr. Barry has his orders. The exit will be sealed, and theÂ TamonÂ will depart immediately, without me.&quot;</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;Yes, sir. You will pardon me, but I gather that your mission is a dangerous one. May I not accompany you?&quot;</div><div class="paragraph">I shook my head.</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;I shall need you here.&quot;</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;But, sir, they are very excited and angry; I have been watching them from the observation ports. And there is a vast crowd of them around the ship.&quot;</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;I had expected that. I thank you for your concern, but I must go alone. Those are the orders. Will you unseal the exit?&quot;</div><div class="paragraph">His &quot;Yes, sir!&quot; was brisk and efficient, but there was a worried frown on his features as he unlocked and released the switch that opened the exit.</div><div class="paragraph">The huge plug of metal, some ten feet in diameter, revolved swiftly and noiselessly, backing slowly in its fine threads into the interior of the ship, gripped by the ponderous gimbals which, as the last threads disengaged, swung the mighty disc to one side, like the door of some great safe.</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;Remember your orders,&quot; I smiled, and with a little gesture to convey an assurance which I certainly did not feel, I strode through the circular opening out into the crowd. The heavy glass secondary door shot down behind me, and I was in the hands of the enemy.</div><div class="paragraph">THEÂ first thing I observed was that my menore, which I had picked up on my way to the exit, was not functioning. Not a person in all that vast multitude wore a menore; the five black-robed dignitaries who marched to meet me wore none.</div><div class="paragraph">Nothing could have showed more clearly that I was in for trouble. To invite a visitor, as Kellen had done, to remove his menore first, was, of course, a polite and courteous thing to do if one wished to communicate by speech; to remove the menore before greeting a visitor wearing one, was a tacit admission of rank enmity; a confession that one&#x27;s thoughts were to be concealed.</div><div class="paragraph">My first impulse was to snatch off my own instrument and fling it in the solemn, ugly faces of the nearest of the five dignataries; I remembered Kellen&#x27;s warning just in time. Quietly, I removed the metal circlet and tucked it under my arm, bowing slightly to the committee of five as I did so.</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;I am Ja Ben,&quot; said the first of the five, with an evil grin. &quot;You are the representative of the Council that we commanded to appear?&quot;</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;I am John Hanson, commander of the shipÂ TamonÂ of the Special Patrol Service. I am here to represent the Central Council,&quot; I replied with dignity.</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;As we commanded,&quot; grinned Ja Ben. &quot;That is good. Follow us and you shall have the evidence you were promised.&quot;</div><div class="paragraph">Ja Ben led the way with two of his black-robed followers. The other two fell in behind me. A virtual prisoner, I marched between them, through the vast crowd that made way grudgingly to let us pass.</div><div class="paragraph">I HAVEÂ seen the people of most of the planets of the known Universe. Many of them, to Earth notions, are odd. But these people, so much like us in many respects, were strangely repulsive.</div><div class="paragraph">Their heads, as Ame Baove had recorded, were not round like ours, but possessed a high bony crest that ran from between their lashless, browless eyes, down to the very nape of their necks. Their skin, even that covering their hairless heads, was a dull and papery white, like parchment, and their eyes were abnormally small, and nearly round. A hateful, ugly people, perpetually scowling, snarling; their<a></a>Â very voices resembled more the growl of wild beasts than the speech of intelligent beings.</div><div class="paragraph">Ja Ben led the way straight to the low but vast building of dun-colored stone that I knew was the administration building of the Control City. We marched up the broad, crowded steps, through the muttering, jeering multitude into the building itself. The guards at the doors stood aside to let us through and the crowd at last was left behind.</div><div class="paragraph">A swift, cylindrical elevator shot us upward, into a great glass-walled laboratory, built like a sort of penthouse on the roof. Ja Ben walked quickly across the room towards a long, glass-topped table; the other four closed in on me silently but suggestively.</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;That is unnecessary,&quot; I said quietly. &quot;See, I am unarmed and completely in your power. I am here as an ambassador of the Central Council, not as a warrior.&quot;</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;Which is as well for you,&quot; grinned Ja Ben. &quot;What I have to show you, you can see quickly, and then depart.&quot;</div><div class="paragraph">From a great cabinet in one corner of the room he took a shining cylinder of dark red metal, and held it up before him, stroking its sleek sides with an affectionate hand.</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;</div><div class="paragraph">HEREÂ it is,&quot; he said, chuckling. &quot;The secret of our power. In here, safely imprisoned now, but capable of being released at our command, is death for every living thing upon any planet we choose to destroy.&quot; He replaced the great cylinder in the cabinet, and picked up in its stead a tiny vial of the same metal, no larger than my little finger, and not so long. &quot;Here,&quot; he said, turning again towards me, &quot;is the means of proving our power to you. Come closer!&quot;</div><div class="paragraph">With my bodyguard of four watching every move, I approached.</div><div class="paragraph">Ja Ben selected a large hollow hemisphere of crystal glass and placed it upon a smooth sheet of flat glass. Next he picked a few blossoms from a bowl that stood, incongruously enough, on the table, and threw them under the glass hemisphere.</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;Flora,&quot; he grinned.</div><div class="paragraph">Hurrying to the other end of the room, he reached into a large flat metal cage and brought forth three small rodent like animals, natives of that world. These he also tossed carelessly under the glass.</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;Fauna,&quot; he grunted, and picked up the tiny metal vial.</div><div class="paragraph">One end of the vial unscrewed. He turned the cap gently, carefully, a strained, anxious look upon his face. My four guards watched him breathlessly, fearfully.</div><div class="paragraph">THEÂ cap came loose at last, disclosing the end of the tube, sealed with a grayish substance that looked like wax. Very quickly Ja Ben rolled the little cylinder under the glass hemisphere, and picked up a beaker that had been bubbling gently on an electric plate close by. Swiftly he poured the thick contents of the beaker around the base of the glass bell. The stuff hardened almost instantly, forming an air-tight seal between the glass hemisphere and the flat plate of glass upon which it rested. Then, with an evil, triumphant smile, Ja Ben looked up.</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;Flora,&quot; he repeated. &quot;Fauna.Â AndÂ death. Watch! The little metal cylinder is plugged still, but in a moment that plug will disappearâ€”simply a volatile solid, you understand. It is going rapidly ... rapidly ... it is almost gone now! Watch ... In an instant now ...Â ah!&quot;</div><div class="paragraph">I saw the gray substance that stopped the entrance of the little metal vial disappear. The rodents ran around and over it, trying to find a crevice by which they might escape. The flowers, bright and beautiful, lay untidily on the bottom of the glass prison.</div><div class="paragraph">Then, just as the last vestige of the gray plug vanished; an amazing, a terrible thing happened. At the mouth of the tiny metal vial a greenish cloud<a></a>Â appeared. I call it a cloud, but it was not that. It was solid, and it spread in every direction, sending out little needles that lashed about and ran together into a solid mass while millions of little needles reached out swiftly.</div><div class="paragraph">One of these little needles touched a scurrying animal. Instantly the tiny brute stiffened, and from his entire body the greenish needles spread swiftly. One of the flowers turned suddenly thick and pulpy with the soft green mass, then another, another of the rodents ...Â God!</div><div class="paragraph">In the space of two heart beats, the entire hemisphere was filled with the green mass, that still moved and writhed and seemed to press against the glass sides as though the urge to expand was insistent, imperative....</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;</div><div class="paragraph">WHATÂ is it?&quot; I whispered, still staring at the thing.</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;Death!&quot; grunted Ja Ben, thrusting his hateful face close to mine, his tiny round eyes, with their lashless lids glinting. &quot;Death, my friend. Go and tell your great Council of this death that we have created for every planet that will not obey us.</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;We have gone back into the history of dealing death and have come back with a death such as the Universe has never known before!</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;Here is a rapacious, deadly fungus we have been two centuries in developing. The spores contained in that tiny metal tube would be invisible to the naked eyeâ€”and yet given but a little time to grow, with air and vegetation and flesh to feed upon, and even that small capsule would wipe out a world. And in the cabinet,&quot;â€”he pointed grinning triumphantlyâ€”&quot;we have, ready for instant use, enough of the spores of this deadly fungas to wipe out all the worlds of your great Alliance.</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;To wipe them out utterly!&quot; he repeated, his voice shaking with a sort of frenzy now. &quot;Every living thing upon their faces, wrapped in that thin, hungry green stuff you see there under that glass. All life wiped out; made uninhabitable so long as the Universe shall endure. And weâ€”weÂ shall be rulers, unquestioned, of that Universe. Tell your doddering CouncilÂ that!&quot; He leaned back against the table, panting with hate.</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;I shall tell them all I have seen; all you have said,&quot; I nodded.</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;You believe we have the power to do all this?&quot;</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;I doâ€”God help me, and the Universe,&quot; I said solemnly.</div><div class="paragraph">THEREÂ was no doubt in my mind. I could see all too clearly how well their plans had been laid; how quickly this hellish growth would strangle all life, once its spores began to develop.</div><div class="paragraph">The only possible chance was to get back to the Council and make my report, with all possible speed, so that every available armed ship of the universe might concentrate here, and wipe out these people before they had time toâ€”</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;I know what you are thinking, my friend,&quot; broke in Ja Ben mockingly. &quot;You might as well have worn the menore! You would have the ships of the Alliance destroy us before we have time to act. We had foreseen that, and have provided for the possibility.</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;As soon as you leave here, ships, provided with many tubes like the one just used for our little demonstration, will be dispersed in every direction. We shall be in constant communication with those ships, and at the least sign of hostility, they will be ordered to depart and spread their death upon every world they can reach. Some of them you may be able to locate and eliminate; a number of them are certain to elude capture in infinite spaceâ€”and if only one, one lone ship, should escape, the doom of the Alliance and millions upon millions of people will be pronounced.</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;I warn you, it will be better, much better, to bow to our wishes, and pay us the tribute we shall demand. Any attempt at resistance will precipitate<a></a>Â certain disaster for your Council and all the worlds the Council governs.&quot;</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;At least, we would wipe you out first,&quot; I said hoarsely.</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;True,&quot; nodded Ja Ben. &quot;But the vengeance of our ships would be a terrible thing! You would not dare to take the chance!&quot;</div><div class="paragraph">I stood there, staring at him in a sort of daze. What he had said was so true; terribly, damnably true.</div><div class="paragraph">If onlyâ€”</div><div class="paragraph">THEREÂ was but one chance I could see, and desperate as it was, I took it. Whirling the heavy metal ring of my menore in my hand, I sprang towards the table.</div><div class="paragraph">If I could break the sealed glass hemisphere, and loose the fungus upon its creators; deal to them the doom they had planned for the universe, then perhaps all might yet be well.</div><div class="paragraph">Ja Ben understood instantly what was in my mind. He and his four aides leaped between me and the table, their tiny round eyes blazing with anger. I struck one of the four viciously with the menore, and with a gasp he fell back and slumped to the floor.</div><div class="paragraph">Before I could break through the opening, however, Ja Ben struck me full in the face with his mighty fist; a blow that sent me, dazed and reeling, into a corner of the room. I brought up with a crash against the cabinet there, groped wildly in an effort to steady myself, and fell to the floor. Almost before I struck, all four of them were upon me.</div><div class="paragraph">They hammered me viciously, shouted at me, cursed me in the universal tongue, but I paid no heed. I pretended to be unconscious, but my heart was beating high with sudden, glorious hope, and in my brain a terrible, merciless plan was forming.</div><div class="paragraph">When I had groped against the cabinet in an effort to regain my balance, my fingers had closed upon one of the little metal vials. As I fell, I covered that hand with my body and hastily hid the tiny tube in a deep pocket of my blue and silver Service uniform.</div><div class="paragraph">SLOWLY, after a few seconds, I opened my eyes and looked up at them, helplessly.</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;Go, now!&quot; snarled Ja Ben, dragging me to my feet. &quot;Go, and tell your Council we are more than a match for youâ€”and for them.&quot; He thrust me, reeling, towards his three assistants. &quot;Take him to his ship, and send aid for Ife Rance, here.&quot; He glanced at the still unconscious figure of the victim of my menore, and then turned to me with a last warning.</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;Remember, one thing more, my friend: you have disintegrator ray equipment upon your ship. You have the little atomic bombs that won for the Alliance the Second War of the Planets. I know that. But if you make the slightest effort to use them, I shall dispatch a supply of the green death to our ships, and they will depart upon their missions at once. You would take upon yourself a terrible responsibility by making the smallest hostile move.</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;Go, nowâ€”and when you return, bring with you members of your great Council who will have the power to hear our demands, and see that they are obeyed. And do not keep us waiting over long, for we are an impatient race.&quot; He bowed, mockingly, and passed his left hand swiftly before his face, his people&#x27;s sign of parting.</div><div class="paragraph">I nodded, not trusting myself to speak, and, hemmed in by my three black-robed conductors, was hurried down the elevator and back through the jeering mob to my ship.</div><div class="paragraph">THEÂ glass secondary door shot up to permit me to enter, and Eitel gripped my shoulder anxiously, his eyes smoldering angrily.</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;You&#x27;re hurt, sir!&quot; he said in his odd, high-pitched voice, staring into my bruised face. &quot;Whatâ€”&quot;</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;It&#x27;s nothing,&quot; I assured him. &quot;Close the exit immediately; we depart at once.&quot;<a></a></div><div class="paragraph">&quot;Yes, sir!&quot; He closed the switch, and the great threaded plug swung gently on its gimbals and began to revolve, swiftly and silently. A little bell sounded sharply, and the great door ceased its motion. Eitel locked the switch and returned the key to his pocket.</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;Good. All men are at their stations?&quot; I asked briskly.</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;Yes, sir! All except these ten, detailed to guard the exit.&quot;</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;Have them report to their regular stations. Issue orders to the ray operators that they are to instantly, and without further orders, destroy any ship that may leave the surface of this planet. Have every atomic bomb crew ready for an instant and concentrated offensive directed at the Control City, but command them not to act under any circumstances unless I give the order. Is that clear, Mr. Eitel?&quot;</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;Yes, sir!&quot;</div><div class="paragraph">I nodded, and turned away, making my way immediately to the navigating room.</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;Mr. Barry,&quot; I said quickly and gravely, &quot;I believe that the fate of the known Universe depends upon us at this moment. We will ascend vertically, at onceâ€”slowlyâ€”until we are just outside the envelope, maintaining only sufficient horizontal motion to keep us directly over the Control City. Will you give the necessary orders?&quot;</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;Immediately, sir!&quot; He pressed the attention button to the operating room and spoke swiftly into the microphone; before he completed the order I had left.</div><div class="paragraph">WEÂ were already ascending when I reached the port forward atomic bomb station. The man in charge, a Zenian, saluted with automatic precision and awaited orders.</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;You have a bomb in readiness?&quot; I asked, returning the salute.</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;Those were my orders, sir.&quot;</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;Correct. Remove it, please.&quot;</div><div class="paragraph">I waited impatiently while the crew removed the bomb from the releasing trap. It was withdrawn at last; a fish-shaped affair, very much like the ancient airplane bombs save that it was no larger than my two fists, placed one upon the other, and that it had four silvery wires running along its sides, from rounded nose to pointed tail, held at a distance from the body by a series of insulating struts.</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;Now,&quot; I said, &quot;how quickly can you put another object in the trap, re-seal the opening, and release the object?&quot;</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;While the Commander counts ten with reasonable speed,&quot; said the Zenian with pride. &quot;We won first honors in the Special Patrol Service contests at the last Examination, the Commander may remember.&quot;</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;I do remember. That is why I selected you for this duty.&quot;</div><div class="paragraph">With hands that trembled a little, I think, I drew forth the little vial of gleaming red metal, while the bombing crew watched me curiously.</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;I shall unscrew the cap from this little vial,&quot; I explained, &quot;and drop it immediately into the releasing trap. Re-seal the trap and release this object as quickly as it is possible to do so. If you can better the time you made to win the honors at the Examinationâ€”in God&#x27;s name, do so!&quot;</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;Yes, sir!&quot; replied the Zenian. He gave brisk orders to his crew, and each of the three men sprang alertly into position.</div><div class="paragraph">ASÂ quickly as I could, I turned off the cap of the little metal vial and dropped it into the trap. The heavy plug, a tiny duplicate of the exit door, clicked shut upon it and spun, whining gently, into the opening. Something clicked sharply, and one of the crew dropped a bar into place. As it shot home, the Zenian in command of the crew pulled the release plunger.</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;Done, sir!&quot; he said proudly.</div><div class="paragraph">I did not reply. My eye fixed upon the observation tube that was following the tiny missile to the ground.</div><div class="paragraph">The Control City was directly below us. I lost sight of the vial almost in<a></a>stantly, but the indicating cross-hairs showed me exactly where the vial would strike; at a point approximately half way between the edge of the city and the great squat pile of the administrating building, with its gleaming glass penthouseâ€”the laboratory in which, only a few minutes before, I had witnessed the demonstration of the death which awaited the Universe.</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;Excellent!&quot; I exclaimed. &quot;Smartly done, men!&quot; I turned and hurried to the navigating room, where the most powerful of our television discs was located.</div><div class="paragraph">The disc was not as perfect as those we have to-day; it was hooded to keep out exterior light, which is not necessary with the later instruments, and it was more unwieldy. However, it did its work, and did it well, in the hands of an experienced operator.</div><div class="paragraph">With only a nod to Barry, I turned the range band to maximum, and brought it swiftly to bear upon that portion of the city in which the little vial had fallen. As I drew the focusing lever towards me, the scene leaped at me through the clear, glowing glass disc.</div><div class="paragraph">FROTH! Green, billowing froth that grew and boiled and spread unceasingly. In places it reached high into the air, and it moved with an eager, inner life that was somehow terrible and revolting. I moved the range hand back, and the view seemed to drop away from me swiftly.</div><div class="paragraph">I could see the whole city now. All one side of it was covered with the spreading green stain that moved and flowed so swiftly. Thousands of tiny black figures were running in the streets, crowding away from the awful danger that menaced them.</div><div class="paragraph">The green patch spread more swiftly always. When I had first seen it, the edges were advancing as rapidly as a man could run; now they were fairly racing, and the speed grew constantly.</div><div class="paragraph">A ship, two of them, three of them came darting from somewhere, towards the administration building, with its glass cupola. I held my breath as the deep, sudden humming from theÂ TamonÂ told me that our rays were busy. Would theyâ€”</div><div class="paragraph">One of the enemy ships disappeared suddenly in a little cloud of dirty, heavy dust that settled swiftly. Another ... and the third. Three little streaks of dust, falling, falling....</div><div class="paragraph">A fourth ship, and a fifth came rushing up, their sides faintly glowing from the speed they had made. The green flood, thick and insistent, was racing up and over the administration building now. It reached the roof, ran swiftly....</div><div class="paragraph">The fourth ship shattered into dust. The fifth settled swiftlyâ€”and then that ship also disappeared, together with a corner of the building. Then the thick green stuff flowed over the whole building and there was nothing to be seen there but a mound of soft, flowing, gray-green stuff that rushed on now with the swiftness of the wind.</div><div class="paragraph">I LOOKEDÂ up, into Barry&#x27;s face.</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;You&#x27;re ill!&quot; he said quickly. &quot;Is there anything I can do, sir?&quot;</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;Yes,&quot; I said, forming the words with difficulty. &quot;Give orders to ascend at emergency speed!&quot;</div><div class="paragraph">For once my first officer hesitated. He glanced at the attraction meter and then turned to me again, wondering.</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;At this height, sir, emergency speed will mean dangerous heating of the surface; perhapsâ€”&quot;</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;I want it white hot, Mr. Barry. She is built to stand it. Emergency speed, pleaseâ€”immediately!&quot;</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;Right, sir!&quot; he said briskly, and gave the order.</div><div class="paragraph">I felt my weight increase as the order was obeyed; gradually the familiar, uncomfortable feeling left me. Silently, Barry and I watched the big surface temperature gauge as it started to move. The heat inside became uncomfortable, grew intense. The sweat poured from us. In the operating<a></a>Â room forward, I could see the men casting quick, wondering glances up at us through the heavy glass partition that lay between.</div><div class="paragraph">The thick, stubby red hand of the surface temperature gauge moved slowly but steadily towards the heavy red line that marked the temperature at which the outer shell of our hull would become incandescent. The hand was within three or four degrees of that mark when I gave Barry the order to arrest our motion.</div><div class="paragraph">When he had given the order, I turned to him and motioned towards the television disc.</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;Look,&quot; I said.</div><div class="paragraph">HEÂ looked, and when at last he tore his face away from the hood, he seemed ten years older.</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;What is it?&quot; he asked in a choked whisper. &quot;Whyâ€”they&#x27;re being wiped out; the whole of that worldâ€”&quot;</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;True. And some of the seeds of that terrible death might have drifted upward, and found a lodging place upon the surface of our ship. That is why I ordered the emergency speed while we were still within the atmospheric envelope, Barry. To burn away that contamination, if it existed. Now we are safe, unlessâ€”&quot;</div><div class="paragraph">I pressed the attention button to the station of the chief of the ray operators.</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;Your report,&quot; I ordered.</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;Nine ships disintegrated, sir,&quot; he replied instantly. &quot;Five before the city was destroyed, four later.&quot;</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;You are certain that none escaped?&quot;</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;Positive, sir.&quot;</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;Very good.&quot;</div><div class="paragraph">I turned to Barry, smiling.</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;Point her nose for Zenia, Mr. Barry,&quot; I said. &quot;As soon as it is feasible, resume emergency speed. There are some very anxious gentlemen there awaiting our report, and I dare not convey it except in person.&quot;</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;Yes, sir!&quot; said Barry crisply.</div><div class="paragraph">THIS, then, is the history of the Forgotten Planet. On the charts of the Universe it appears as an unnamed world. No ship is permitted to pass close enough to it so that its attraction is greater than that of the nearest other mass. A permanent outpost of fixed-station ships, with headquarters upon Jaron, the closest world, is maintained by the Council.</div><div class="paragraph">There are millions of people who might be greatly disturbed if they knew of this potential menace that lurks in the midst of our Universe, but they do not know. The wisdom of the Council made certain of that.</div><div class="paragraph">But, in order that in the ages to come there might be a record of this matter, I have been asked to prepare this document for the sealed archives of the Alliance.

<p>In our last post, we created our first instance of the Amazon Interactive Video Service (Amazon IVS) player to playback the live stream that we previously created. Today, we'll look at the various methods and events that are available in the Amazon IVS Player that we can use to enhance the user experience when playing back a live stream.</p>
<p>\</p>
<h2 id="recap">Recap</h2>
<p>Let's quickly revisit the Amazon IVS player that we created in our last post, just to give us a starting point to build on in this post. To recap, in order to playback an Amazon IVS live stream, we included the Amazon IVS player <code>&lt;script&gt;</code>, added a <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> element, and then used a bit of JavaScript to create the player instance, attach it to the <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> element, loaded the stream, and finally started playback. <a href="https://codepen.io/recursivecodes/pen/mdxXpWp">The code and rendered player looked like this</a>.</p>
<p>\</p>
<h2 id="enhancingtheplayerexperience">Enhancing the Player Experience</h2>
<p>If basic playback is all that you need for your application, then weâ€™re already there! But sometimes we want to add a bit more to the experience! For that, the Amazon IVS player SDK gives us additional methods and events that we can use to make things shinier. For example, wouldnâ€™t it be cool to add an â€˜online/offlineâ€™ indicator to the page so that users can quickly see the status of the current stream? What about displaying the latency or resolution of the current stream? What about accessibility? Letâ€™s dig into the player SDK and check out some things that we can do. We wonâ€™t look extensively at every single method and event of the SDK, so check out the&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://aws.github.io/amazon-ivs-player-docs/1.11.0/web/index.html">full player documentation</a></strong>&nbsp;when you get started with your own application.</p>
<p>\</p>
<h2 id="playereventlisteners">Player Event Listeners</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/7GGjdbIpEWhSoNNMb3i5kpsuefF3-nra2hx2.gif.webp" alt="" /></p>
<p>We can attach listeners to several events and player states. To do this, we use the&nbsp;<code>addEventListener</code>&nbsp;method on the instance of the player that we created. For example, to add an â€˜online/offlineâ€™ indicator, we can add the following HTML (styled with a bit of Bootstrap):</p>
<p>\</p>
<pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">&lt;span class="badge bg-danger text-white mb-3" id="online-indicator"&gt;Offline&lt;/span&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>\
And attach a listener that calls the&nbsp;<code>playerOnline()</code>&nbsp;method when the player enters a&nbsp;<code>PLAYING</code>&nbsp;state.</p>
<p>\</p>
<pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">ivsPlayer.addEventListener(IVSPlayer.PlayerState.PLAYING, playerOnline);
</code></pre>
<p>\
The&nbsp;<code>playerOnline()</code>&nbsp;method updates the status indicator to show our users that the stream is online.</p>
<p>\</p>
<pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">const playerOnline = () =&gt; {
  const indicator = document.getElementById('online-indicator');
  indicator.classList.remove('bg-danger');
  indicator.classList.add('bg-success');
  indicator.innerHTML = 'Online';
}
</code></pre>
<p>\
We can also listen for the&nbsp;<code>IDLE</code>&nbsp;(paused) and&nbsp;<code>ENDED</code>&nbsp;states, and update the indicator to show that the stream is offline.</p>
<p>\</p>
<pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">ivsPlayer.addEventListener(IVSPlayer.PlayerState.ENDED, playerOffline);
ivsPlayer.addEventListener(IVSPlayer.PlayerState.IDLE, playerOffline);
</code></pre>
<p>\
And toggle the status indicator accordingly.</p>
<p>\</p>
<pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">const playerOffline = () =&gt; {
  const indicator = document.getElementById('online-indicator');
  indicator.classList.add('bg-danger');
  indicator.classList.remove('bg-success');
  indicator.innerHTML = 'Offline';
}
</code></pre>
<p>\</p>
<p>:::info
<strong>Here Be Dragons:</strong>&nbsp;It's undocumented, but sometimes I "cheat" and listen for the&nbsp;<code>STATE_CHANGED</code>&nbsp;event which receives a string indicating the destination state. Use at your own risk.</p>
<p>:::</p>
<p>\</p>
<pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">&lt;span class="badge bg-info ms-1" id="status"&gt;Current State: &lt;i id="current-state"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>\</p>
<pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">ivsPlayer.addEventListener(IVSPlayer.PlayerEventType.STATE_CHANGED, (state) =&gt; {
    document.getElementById('current-state').innerHTML = state;
});
</code></pre>
<p>\
<a href="https://codepen.io/recursivecodes/pen/BarYrqw">Letâ€™s see how this looks in action!</a> Try to toggle playback with the pause button a few times to see the status indicators update in response to the event handlers that we just added.</p>
<p>\</p>
<h2 id="closedcaptions">Closed Captions</h2>
<p>There are additional&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://aws.github.io/amazon-ivs-player-docs/1.11.0/web/index.html#playereventtype">PlayerEventType</a></strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://aws.github.io/amazon-ivs-player-docs/1.11.0/web/index.html#playerstate">PlayerState</a></strong>&nbsp;values that we can attach listeners to. Another&nbsp;<strong>really helpful</strong>&nbsp;player event is the&nbsp;<code>TEXT_CUE</code>&nbsp;event. If our live stream contains closed caption data, this event will contain the relevant caption text. Let's update our player to listen for this event and render the caption text from another one of our&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-ivs-player-web-sample#test-streams">test streams</a></strong>&nbsp;that contain closed captions.</p>
<p>\
First, update the HTML to create a container to display the captions. We'll use a little Bootstrap magic to place the caption text on top of the player and style it a bit.</p>
<p>\</p>
<pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">&lt;div class="position-relative"&gt;
    &lt;video id="video-player" controls autoplay playsinline&gt;&lt;/video&gt;
    &lt;div 
        class="position-relative mx-auto bg-dark bg-opacity-50 rounded text-white text-center fs-3 d-none" 
        style="width: 90%; bottom: 100px;" 
        id="captions"&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>\
In our handler for the&nbsp;<code>TEXT_CUE</code>&nbsp;event, we'll hide the container if there is no text to display, show it and populate the text if there is something to display.</p>
<p>\</p>
<pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">ivsPlayer.addEventListener(IVSPlayer.PlayerEventType.TEXT_CUE, (e) =&gt; {
    const caption = e.text;
    const captionsEl = document.getElementById('captions');
    if(caption.length) {
        captionsEl.innerHTML = caption;
        captionsEl.classList.remove('d-none');
    }
    else {
        captionsEl.classList.add('d-none');
        captionsEl.innerHTML = '';
    }
});
</code></pre>
<p>\
<a href="https://codepen.io/recursivecodes/pen/BarroJW">Let's see this one in action!</a> If you're not hearing impaired, ignore the fact that the video contains no actual audio that matches the caption text. This is indeed an actual feed with properly embedded captions, but the text is used to illustrate the concept of closed captions at certain points in the video feed.</p>
<p>\</p>
<p>:::tip
What about real-time captions for live streams with auto-translate? It's possible with AWS Transcribe and Amazon Translate. Check out the&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-ivs-auto-captions-web-demo">demo on GitHub</a></strong>.</p>
<p>:::</p>
<p>\</p>
<h2 id="playermethods">Player Methods</h2>
<p>Besides the various events and states that we looked at above, there are several methods that the&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://aws.github.io/amazon-ivs-player-docs/1.11.0/web/interfaces/player.html">player</a></strong>&nbsp;exposes several methods that give us visibility into various settings and automate playback state. Letâ€™s look at how we can use some of these to display information about the current stream.</p>
<p>\</p>
<h3 id="streamlatencyandquality">Stream Latency and Quality</h3>
<p>Sometimes we want to display the current latency and resolution of the stream being played. This can enhance user experience, or take action based on a business need. Letâ€™s add some UI elements to display the current stream latency, quality, and frame rate. For the latency value, weâ€™ll use&nbsp;<code>setInterval</code>&nbsp;to update the value every 1.5 seconds, and for quality and frame rate, weâ€™ll update the UI in a&nbsp;<code>PLAYING</code>&nbsp;event handler.</p>
<p>\</p>
<pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">setInterval(() =&gt; {
    document.getElementById('latency').innerHTML = ivsPlayer.getLiveLatency().toFixed(2);
  }, 1500);

ivsPlayer.addEventListener(IVSPlayer.PlayerState.PLAYING, () =&gt; {
    const quality = ivsPlayer.getQuality();
    document.getElementById('quality').innerHTML = quality.name;
    document.getElementById('framerate').innerHTML = quality.framerate;
});
</code></pre>
<p>\
However, the Amazon IVS player can adapt the playback quality based on current network conditions, so the quality can change as the stream is being played! To accommodate, we can listen for the&nbsp;<code>QUALITY_CHANGED</code>&nbsp;event and update the UI to display the proper value as the stream continues to play.</p>
<p>\</p>
<pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">ivsPlayer.addEventListener(IVSPlayer.PlayerEventType.QUALITY_CHANGED, (quality) =&gt; {
    document.getElementById('quality').innerHTML = quality.name;
});
</code></pre>
<p>\</p>
<h3 id="manuallysettingquality">Manually Setting Quality</h3>
<p>Even though the player intelligently decides the best quality (for&nbsp;<code>STANDARD</code>&nbsp;streams), we can also let our viewers manually choose a different quality. Letâ€™s add a button to toggle through the available qualities.</p>
<p>\</p>
<pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">&lt;button class="btn btn-primary" id="toggle-quality"&gt;Toggle Quality&lt;/button&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>\
A few globals to store the available and current quality values (we'll update these in the&nbsp;<code>PLAYING</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>QUALITY_CHANGED</code>&nbsp;handlers as you'll see in the final demo).</p>
<p>\</p>
<pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">let qualities, currentQuality;
</code></pre>
<p>\
And a handler for the button clicks event that will toggle the quality to the next available quality.</p>
<p>\</p>
<p>:::tip
<strong>Important Note:</strong>&nbsp;There is a&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ivs/latest/userguide/player-web.html#web-issues">known issue with the player</a></strong>&nbsp;that ignores calls to&nbsp;<code>setQuality()</code>&nbsp;when native HTML5 controls are enabled. We'll work around this by temporarily disabling them before we set the quality, and then re-enabling them.</p>
<p>:::</p>
<p>\</p>
<pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">document.getElementById('toggle-quality').addEventListener('click', () =&gt; {
    const qualIdx = qualities.findIndex((e) =&gt; e.name == currentQuality.name);
    const nextIdx = qualIdx &lt; qualities.length - 1 ? qualIdx + 1 : 0;
    const playerEl = document.getElementById('video-player');
    playerEl.removeAttribute('controls');
    ivsPlayer.setQuality(qualities[nextIdx]);
    playerEl.setAttribute('controls', 'controls');
});
</code></pre>
<p>\
If we wanted to disable the native HTML controls - or just add an external button to control playback - we can add a button:</p>
<p>\</p>
<pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">&lt;button class="btn btn-primary" id="toggle-playback"&gt;Toggle Playback&lt;/button&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>\
And use the&nbsp;<code>play()</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>pause()</code>&nbsp;methods of the player.</p>
<p>\</p>
<pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">document.getElementById('toggle-playback').addEventListener('click', () =&gt; {
    ivsPlayer.isPaused() ? ivsPlayer.play() : ivsPlayer.pause();
});
</code></pre>
<p>\
Thatâ€™s a lot of features for this demo, so <a href="https://codepen.io/recursivecodes/pen/dymmGwV">letâ€™s see it running!</a> Notice how the latency, quality, and frame rate update. Also, try manually changing the quality by clicking on the button below the video player and toggling playback with the external button.</p>
<p>\</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Weâ€™ve covered a&nbsp;<strong>ton</strong>&nbsp;of great stuff in the Amazon IVS player SDK that can help us enhance the playback experience for our users, but weâ€™ve barely scratched the surface of what the player can do. Check out the&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://aws.github.io/amazon-ivs-player-docs/1.11.0/web/index.html">full player documentation</a></strong>&nbsp;for all the events, states, and methods that you can use for your production application. In our next post, weâ€™re going to see how to add some interactivity to our stream via custom-timed metadata.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>\
Whatâ€™s up?</p>
<p>\
Interest rates. Prices. Stress.</p>
<p>\
In the US, job listings just fell to pandemic lows, property values started to collapse, earnings are down across the board, and unsold goods are piling up in many stores.</p>
<p>\
Elsewhere, pension funds are on the verge of insolvency and governments are on the brink of default. Plus war, food shortages, chip shortages, dollar shortages, energy shortages, inflation, starvation, and general human suffering.</p>
<p>\
Yet, you still make money. You earn an income. You have some wealth, even if itâ€™s just spare cash from your paycheck, a pension, or savings youâ€™ve accumulated over the years.</p>
<p>\
Less with each passing day, but money nonetheless.</p>
<p>\
What will you do with that money?</p>
<p>\
Not buy bitcoin or any other crypto.</p>
<h1 id="waituntilthepricegoesup">Wait until the price goes up</h1>
<p>â€œMacroâ€ conditions suck. Youâ€™re worried about food, heat, shelter, and your job. Maybe once things stabilize, youâ€™ll put some money into speculative financial assets like crypto.</p>
<p>\
Maybe not.</p>
<p>\
At the same time, bitcoinâ€™s price sits at historic lows with lots of room to move up, even if just for a temporary relief rally or one of its outrageous pumps.</p>
<p>\
What will you do if its price goes up 25% this month? If some altcoins double in price <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/09/the-us-dollar-is-decimating-world-currencies-heres-how-other-countries-are-responding">while your governmentâ€™s money keeps crashing</a>, as all major currencies except the US dollar have done this year?</p>
<p>\
Nothing will change about bitcoin, cryptocurrency markets, or their future prospects, but youâ€™ll feel an itch to buy. You just lost 25% of your purchasing power by holding cash instead of crypto. How much more are you willing to risk losing?</p>
<p>\
Your mind will tell you youâ€™re getting a better deal because â€œthe bottomâ€™s inâ€ or â€œitâ€™s decoupling from the stock marketâ€ or â€œitâ€™s finally going up.â€</p>
<h1 id="afleetingtemptation">A fleeting temptation</h1>
<p>It wonâ€™t be a better deal, but it will feel like one.</p>
<p>\
When financial assets go up, you canâ€™t help but want to put money in â€” even if you donâ€™t have money to spare. When they go down, you canâ€™t help but want to keep money out â€” even if you have money to spare.</p>
<p>\
This is an odd phenomenon but well-established among behavioral economists.</p>
<p>\
For real things like houses, cars, gas, and toiletries, you get excited when prices go down. For fake things like stocks, bonds, and crypto, you get worried when prices go down.</p>
<p>\
I guess how you feel depends on whether you want to buy or sell.</p>
<h1 id="astrangethinginnit">A strange thing, innit?</h1>
<p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1360/1*5LJXy2cPYPloCrQc81b34A.jpeg" alt="Not so popular anymore" /></p>
<p>Do you think itâ€™s funny that some people bought bitcoin at $60,000 but wonâ€™t buy it at $20,000?</p>
<p>\
A handful gave up everything to buy at the peak. Some of them sold at $40,000 or $30,000.</p>
<p>\
Others still hold today but havenâ€™t bought any more since then.</p>
<p>\
Why?</p>
<p>\
Because they never wanted to buy bitcoin in the first place. <em>They wanted to sell it for more than they bought it for.</em></p>
<p>\
Buying was a necessary first step.</p>
<p>\
When bitcoinâ€™s price hit $60,000 on an upswing, they thought they could make money. When its price hit $30,000 on a downswing, they thought they couldnâ€™t.</p>
<p>\
Now, at $20,000, they think itâ€™s dead. In any event, they have bigger things to worry about.</p>
<p>Immutability, censorship-resistance, permissionless innovation, open finance, anti-fragility, yada yada?</p>
<p>\
Whatever. To paraphrase 2PAC, â€œHelfman cares, if donâ€™t nobody else care.â€</p>
<p>\
Then again, you canâ€™t eat bitcoin (though you can mine it for heat).</p>
<h1 id="recencybias">Recency bias</h1>
<p>With crypto, the market moves in a specific pattern:</p>
<p>\</p>
<ol>
<li>Crypto flows into the hands of people who want it more than their governmentâ€™s money. Eventually, the market runs out of sellers. Prices go up.</li>
<li>Once prices go up long enough that people think prices will keep going up, new buyers come into the market. Prices go up higher.</li>
<li>Once prices go high enough that people decide they want to trade it for more of their governmentâ€™s money, they sell. Prices go down.</li>
<li>Once prices go down long enough for people to think prices will keep going down, new sellers come into the market. Prices go down more until enough crypto flows into the hands of people who want it more than their governmentâ€™s money.</li>
</ol>
<p>\
Then, the cycle continues.</p>
<p>\
As I covered at length earlier this year in my newsletter, <em>Crypto is Easy,</em> the historical â€œmarket bottomâ€ signals flashed in May and June.</p>
<p>\
During previous market bottoms, bitcoinâ€™s price went up and down 25% to 75% after those signals flashed. While that means a drop to $14,000 would make sense, what if that never happens, despite the horrible â€œmacroâ€ conditions or potential 2008-style financial catastrophe?</p>
<p>\
What if so many people have already sold that itâ€™s impossible for buyers to find sellers at Juneâ€™s $17,600 low or any lower price? What if the worst does happen, but crypto only drops a little while equities and other assets drop a lot?</p>
<p>\
Doesnâ€™t matter. Youâ€™ll wait until the price goes up long enough for people to think it will keep going up. Once inflationâ€™s done, world peace breaks out, your jobâ€™s secure, gas flows again, and the coast is clear.</p>
<p>\
Except, the coast will never be clear.</p>
<p>\
Crypto prices have dropped 50% in bull and bear markets, whether thereâ€™s a global crisis or not, in good times like 2019 and 2021, and in bad times like 2020 and 2022.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="bitcoinunsafeatanypricehttpshackernooncombitcoinunsafeatanyprice"><a href="https://hackernoon.com/bitcoin-unsafe-at-any-price">Bitcoin: Unsafe at Any Price</a></h3>
<hr />
<h1 id="youarethemoneythatyouseek">You are the money that you seek</h1>
<p>For your mental health, sense of safety, and near-term financial security, maybe it does make sense to wait for a higher price.</p>
<p>\
Thatâ€™s ok. You donâ€™t need to buy crypto to make money. You have skills and a mindset that people will pay for. You can make money off of your time, talent, energy, and all the things that make you an incredible person.</p>
<p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*y7RoxNiYTEhayjLe" alt="Credit shown in the watermark on this picture, @2000sfashionista." /></p>
<p>\
If you do that, you wonâ€™t have to think about the prices of financial assets. It wonâ€™t matter whether your pension fund is solvent, your currency collapses, the value of your house drops, or your government screws everything up.</p>
<p>\
Trust in yourself. Hope for the best. Keep working.</p>
<p>\
Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies sit at historic lows and they will function when your government doesnâ€™t.</p>
<p>\
As you have money, put a little into this market, even if it feels risky and uncomfortable. Today, youâ€™re paying less for that risk and discomfort than you have in years, with more upside than ever.</p>
<p>\
Learn how to custody your bitcoin in your self-hosted wallet. Stake or delegate your altcoins. Deposit crypto into liquidity pools. Try out new dapps and wallets. Discover opportunities to enrich your life with NFTs, Web3 technology, and new communities.</p>
<p>\
Own a source of wealth that doesnâ€™t depend on what your central bank does with your money.</p>
<p>\
Grow with this asset class.</p>
<p>\
You may want to follow my <a href="https://cryptoiseasy.substack.com/p/crypto-is-easy-special-issue-my-plan">My Plan for Buying and Selling Bitcoin</a>. If you do that, youâ€™ll get better results than most traders and people who dollar-cost average.</p>
<p>\
(Some traders will do much better.)</p>
<p>\
If you donâ€™t follow my plan, youâ€™ll do ok, too. Buy now and you wonâ€™t need to buy later.</p>
<p>\
You may not end up with Lambos, 100x moonshots, and eternal wealth, but youâ€™ll get a stake in the financial networks of the future.</p>
<p>\
The legacy financial system is held together with gum wads and rubber bands. Everything sucks.</p>
<p>\
If you wait for everything to get better, you could be waiting forever.</p>

Fix the resemblance in the mind; it will help you. In business writing it is best to make the looped small d. It is just as legible as the stem and can be made more rapidly. The loop below the base line in small g should be made without finger motion. We favor the blunt style of small g and y at the end of words, and this ending should be shorter than the loop. Fix in your mind the length of this abbreviated g. Small q is a little shorter below the base line than g.

 Chapter XXVII: Taxes paid by the producer</em></div><h2>CHAPTER XXVII. TAXES PAID BY THE PRODUCER.</h2><div class="paragraph">M.Â SayÂ greatly magnifies the inconveniences which result if a tax on a manufactured commodity is levied at an early, rather than at a late period of its manufacture. The manufacturers, he observes, through whose hands the commodity may successively pass, must employ greater funds in consequence of having to advance the tax, which is often attended with considerable difficulty to a manufacturer of very limited capital and credit. To this observation no objection can be made.</div><div class="paragraph">Another inconvenience on which he dwells is, that in consequence of the advance of the tax, the profits on the advance also must be charged to the consumer, and that this addi<a></a>tional tax is one from which the treasury derives no advantage.</div><div class="paragraph">In this latter objection I cannot agree with M. Say. The state, we will suppose, wants to raiseÂ immediatelyÂ 1000l.Â and levies it on a manufacturer, who will not, for a twelve-month, be able to charge it to the consumer on his finished commodity. In consequence of such delay, he is obliged to charge for his commodity an additional price, not only of 1000l.Â the amount of the tax, but probably of 1100l., 100l.Â being for interest on the 1000l.Â advanced. But in return for this additional 100l.Â paid by the consumer, he has a real benefit, inasmuch as his payment of the tax which Government required immediately, and which he must finally pay, has been postponed for a year; an opportunity, therefore, has been afforded to him of lending to the manufacturer, who had occasion for it, the 1000l.Â at 10 per cent., or at any other rate of interest which might be agreed upon. </div><div class="paragraph">Eleven hundred pounds payable at the end of one year, when money is at 10 per cent. interest, is of no more value than 1000l.Â to be paid immediately. If Government delayed receiving the tax for one<a></a>Â year till the manufacture of the commodity was completed, it would, perhaps, be obliged to issue an Exchequer bill bearing interest, and it would pay as much for interest as the consumer would save in price, excepting, indeed, that portion of the price which the manufacturer might be enabled, in consequence of the tax, to add to his own real gains. </div><div class="paragraph">If, for the interest of the Exchequer bill, Government would have paid 5 per cent., a tax of 50l.Â is saved by not issuing it. If the manufacturer borrowed the additional capital at 5 per cent., and charged the consumer 10 per cent., he also will have gained 5 per cent. on his advance over and above his usual profits, so that the manufacturer and Government together gain, or save, precisely the sum which the consumer pays.</div><div class="paragraph">M. Simonde, in his excellent work,Â De la Richesse Commerciale, following the same line of argument as M. Say, has calculated that a tax of 4000 francs, paid originally by a manufacturer, whose profits were at the moderate rate of 10 per cent., would, if the commodity manufactured only passed through the hands of five different persons, be raised to the consumer to<a></a>Â the sum of 6734 francs. </div><div class="paragraph">This calculation proceeds on the supposition, that he who first advanced the tax, would receive from the next manufacturer 4400 francs, and he again from the next, 4840 francs; so that at each step 10 per cent. on its value would be added to it. This is to suppose that the value of the tax would be accumulating at compound interest, not at the rate of 10 per cent. per annum, but at an absolute rate of 10 per cent., at every step of its progress. </div><div class="paragraph">This opinion of M. de Simonde would be correct if five years elapsed between the first advance of the tax, and the sale of the taxed commodity to the consumer; but if one year only elapsed, a remuneration of 400 francs, instead of 2734, would give a profit at the rate of 10 per cent. per annum, to all who had contributed to the advance of the tax, whether the commodity had passed through the hands of five manufacturers or fifty.</div><div class="Divider"><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i></div><div class="paragraph"><em>About HackerNoon Book Series: We bring you the most important technical, scientific, and insightful public domain books.

</div><h2>Chapter V. NURSING THE COMMERCIALLY ILL
</h2><div class="paragraph">I then arranged with Mr. Gates to accept a position whereby he could help me unravel these tangled affairs, and become, like myself, a man of business, but it was agreed between us that he should not abandon his larger and more important plans for working out some philanthropic aspirations that he had.</div><div class="paragraph">Right here I may stop to give credit to Mr. Gates for possessing a combination of rare business ability, very highly developed and very honourably exercised, overshadowed by a passion to accomplish some great and far-reaching benefits to mankind, the influence of which will last. He is the chairman of the General Education Board and active in many other boards, and for years he has helped in the various plans that we have been interested in where money was given in the hope that it would do something more than temporary service.</div><div class="paragraph">Mr. Gates has for many years been closely associated with my personal affairs. He has been through strenuous times with me, and has taken cares of many kinds off my shoulders, leaving me more time to play golf, plan roads, move trees, and follow other congenial occupations. His efforts in the investigations in connection with our educational contributions, our medical research, and other kindred works have been very successful. During the last ten or twelve years my son has shared with Mr. Gates the responsibility of this work, and more recently Mr. Starr J. Murphy has also joined with us to help Mr. Gates, who has borne the heat and burden of the day, and has well earned some leisure which we have wanted him to enjoy.</div><div class="paragraph">But to return to the story of our troubled investments: Mr. Gates went into the study of each of these business concerns, and did the best he could with them. It has been our <a>]</a>policy never to allow a company in which we had an interest to be thrown into the bankruptcy court if we could prevent it; for receiverships are very costly in many ways and often involve heavy sacrifices of genuine values. </div><div class="paragraph">Our plan has been to stay with the institution, nurse it, lend it money when necessary, improve facilities, cheapen production, and avail ourselves of the opportunities which time and patience are likely to bring to make it self-sustaining and successful. So we went carefully through the affairs of these crippled enterprises in the hard times of 1893 and 1894, carrying many of them for years after; sometimes buying the interests of others and sometimes selling our own interest, but all or nearly all escaped the expenses and humiliation of bankruptcy, receivership, and foreclosure.</div><div class="paragraph">Before these matters were entirely closed up we had a vast amount of experience in the doctoring of the commercially ill. My only excuse for dwelling upon the subject at this late day is to point out the fact to some business men who get discouraged that much can be done by careful and patient attention, even when the business is apparently in very deep water. It requires two things: some added capital, put in by one&#x27;s self or secured from others, and a strict adherence to the sound natural laws of business.</div><div class="Divider"><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i></div><div class="paragraph"><em>About HackerNoon Book Series: We bring you the most important technical, scientific, and insightful public domain books.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>One of Unleashâ€™s most requested Enterprise features is now available to all users.</strong></p>
<p>\
You spoke, we listened: Available now, all open-source users of <a href="https://www.getunleash.io/">Unleash</a> who upgrade to version 4.16 will get access to <a href="https://docs.getunleash.io/advanced/strategy_constraints">strategy constraints</a> and <a href="https://docs.getunleash.io/user_guide/unleash_context#custom-context-fields">custom context fields</a>.</p>
<p>\
<strong>Add strategy constraints to your Unleash today</strong></p>
<p>| <a href="https://www.getunleash.io/">GET STARTED</a> | <a href="https://docs.getunleash.io/deploy/migration_guide">UPGRADE NOW</a> |
|:---:|:---:|</p>
<h3 id="whatarestrategyconstraints"><strong>What are Strategy Constraints?</strong></h3>
<p>Strategy constraints give you granular control over who gets to see a specific feature by adding preconditions to one of your activation strategies. You can add preconditions for any Unleash context field. </p>
<p>\
As of version 4.16, Unleash supports <a href="https://docs.getunleash.io/advanced/strategy_constraints">15 different constraint operators</a>, fine-tuned for a number of use cases.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqtqMFhLRBE?embedable=true">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqtqMFhLRBE?embedable=true</a></p>
<p>Hereâ€™s an example: A gradual rollout strategy could target 50% of a user base. But what if you want to only target users with a company email? For that, youâ€™ll need strategy constraints.</p>
<p>\
Quickly schedule feature releases and feature availability windows. Target feature rollout to users based on variables like region or email address domain. Generate user demand with time-limited feature releases. There are a ton of ways to use strategy constraints, and this is only scratching the surface.</p>
<p>\
Any strategy on any feature can have as many strategy constraints as you want. Note that when a strategy is evaluated, all strategy constraints must be met for the strategy to pass.</p>
<p>\
Youâ€™ll find that, in most cases, strategy constraints replace the need for <a href="https://docs.getunleash.io/advanced/custom_activation_strategy">custom activation strategies</a>. This means that you no longer need to define custom strategies, then implement them across your SDKs.</p>
<h3 id="howdoiusestrategyconstraints"><strong>How Do I Use Strategy Constraints?</strong></h3>
<p>Note: Before creating strategy constraints, youâ€™ll need to set up a <a href="https://docs.getunleash.io/user_guide/create_feature_toggle">feature toggle</a> in Unleash, then give it an <a href="https://docs.getunleash.io/user_guide/activation_strategy">activation strategy</a>.</p>
<h4 id="openthestrategyconstraintsmenu"><strong>Open the Strategy Constraints Menu</strong></h4>
<p>Find and select the <strong>edit strategy</strong> button on the strategy you are working with.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/4OR19mtDj0OZtFF0lAqcUYlpjL72-fdb3q8g.jpeg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Click the <strong>add constraint</strong> button to open the constraints menu.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/4OR19mtDj0OZtFF0lAqcUYlpjL72-9nc3qdr.jpeg" alt="" /></p>
<h4 id="addandconfiguretheconstraint"><strong>Add and Configure the Constraint</strong></h4>
<ol>
<li><p>From the <strong>Context Field</strong> dropdown, select the context field you would like to constrain the strategy on. Choose a constraint operator.</p></li>
<li><p>Define the values to use for this constraint. The operator you select determines whether you can define one or multiple values and what format they can have.</p></li>
<li><p>Save the <strong>constraint</strong>, then save the <strong>strategy</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/4OR19mtDj0OZtFF0lAqcUYlpjL72-hqd3qh1.jpeg" alt="" /></p></li>
</ol>
<p>If you want to update an existing constraint, find the constraint in the <strong>edit strategy</strong> screen and use the constraint's <strong>edit</strong> button.</p>
<p>\
Because strategy constraints use Unleash context fields, make sure you pass the relevant context to your <a href="https://docs.getunleash.io/sdks">client SDK</a>. Read more in the <strong>SDK</strong> section of our <a href="https://docs.getunleash.io/advanced/strategy_constraints#sdks">strategy constraints documentation</a>.</p>
<h3 id="strategyconstraintsareavailabletodaytoallversion416opensourceusers"><strong>Strategy Constraints are Available Today to All Version 4.16 Open source Users</strong></h3>
<p>While strategy constraints are now free to all users, you wonâ€™t have access to the feature unless you upgrade to version 4.16. For users with versions 4.0 and above, you can grab the latest version from the Docker hub. Users of earlier versions should reference our <a href="https://docs.getunleash.io/deploy/migration_guide">migration guide</a> before upgrading.</p>
<p>\
Feel free to play around first! Try out our <a href="https://app.unleash-hosted.com/demo">demo instance</a> to get a quick taste of what strategy constraints can do.</p>

        <![CDATA[<div class="paragraph">Creating video content may not be the easiest marketing strategy because it is time consuming and requires a lot of resources, but video marketing is becoming the go-to method due to the results that they provide.Â </div><div class="paragraph">The statistics donâ€™t lie and 89% of video marketers agree that video increases ROI, 87% claim that video has increased organic traffic, whereas 80% have chalked up video content for the reason sales have increased.Â </div><h2>Youtube and the birth of Video Marketing</h2><div class="paragraph">It can be said that Youtube spawned the birth of video marketing. In 2005, Youtube added a whole new dimension to cyberspace and opened up a sector of digital marketing. As technology evolved alongside the incorporation of sharing culture and social media, it became increasingly easy to make videos as well as consume that form of content.Â </div><div class="paragraph">Today, the average user spends over <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/state-of-video-marketing-new-data">19 hours</a> a week purely for video watching purposes. The statistics do not include any other social media or browsing activities. The most popular app for viewing video content is Youtube with <a href="https://www.globalmediainsight.com/blog/youtube-users-statistics/">2.1 billion users</a>, followed by 1 billion users <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1267892/tiktok-global-mau/#:~:text=TikTok%20global%20monthly%20active%20users%202018%2D2021&amp;text=In%20September%202021%2C%20social%20video,million%20MAU%20in%20July%202020.">on TikTok</a>. TikTok is the English counterpart of Chinese developed DouYin and it has amassed a huge user base.Â </div><div class="paragraph">Marketers have noticed that videos retained more audiences, create a more lasting impression, and also generated more leads and engagement, which led it to become so successfully incorporated into marketing campaigns.Â </div><h2>How Video Marketing has changed Growth Marketing forever</h2><div class="paragraph">Itâ€™s easy to measure the success of a video via its virality and how much engagement it gets. In order to maximize marketability, the audiences and their behavior are analyzed in order to create content that continues to resonate with them.Â </div><div class="paragraph">Never before has there been any other form of media that drives engagement as strongly as video marketing. Viewers find videos much more relatable and it drives a stronger response.Â </div><div class="paragraph">In fact, when video is added to websites, it improves SEO immediately. People are more likely to spend more time on the page because of the video. By meeting that consumerâ€™s need to connect, it will create a higher chance of converting them into a customer.</div><div class="paragraph">Growth marketing is targeted at the customer instead of the product and data is constantly being analyzed and the campaign or product constantly tweaked accordingly. But it isnâ€™t all about closing that sale - videos are a great resource for educating customers and for building trust.Â </div><div class="paragraph">In such an information-rich environment, it can be hard to filter through the noise and find what is accurate, which is why videos are one of the go-to formats for tutorials. People can write whatever they want or manipulate images, but videos are much more reliable. While it doesnâ€™t mean that there arenâ€™t any misleading videos out there, Youtube has created a strong culture of information sharing and many creators are encouraged to create authentic and genuine content in order to become sustainable.Â </div><h2>Has TikTok changed consumer behavior patterns?</h2><div class="paragraph">TikTok is much more interactive than its traditional predecessor - reacting or remixing a video is a function that is directly accessible to TikTok users. In fact, the <a href="https://www.scmp.com/magazines/style/celebrity/article/3194109/meet-khaby-lame-tiktoks-most-followed-influencer-how">biggest TikTok star</a> doesnâ€™t say a single word in his videos and simply reacts by gesturing silently to videos that have already been posted on TikTok. The reception he received is a direct commentary of the cultural trends of our digital age and how it affects marketing strategies.Â </div><div class="paragraph">Consumers are looking to connect in a real and relatable way. HubSpot Research released information that â€œconsumers and customers <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/video-marketing">prefer lower quality</a>, &quot;authentic&quot; video over high-quality video that seems artificial and inauthentic.â€</div><h2>How does quality factor into videos in the current landscape?</h2><div class="paragraph">As mentioned above, lower quality videos offer a more authentic experience for consumers, but that just means that current generations do not enjoy videos that are scripted or high production. That doesnâ€™t mean that the quality of the content should be overlooked. Content is king in this era more than ever due to the need for authenticity and connection. It has to strongly resonate with consumers, which will in turn, build trust and a meaningful connection with audiences which is extremely important for Millennial and Gen Z consumers.Â </div><div class="paragraph">This is beneficial for businesses because professional video production can cost a pretty penny. Today, large corporations can get away with filming a dancing video on their employeeâ€™s smartphone and have it go viral, which is worth so much more than spending a large sum of money on a professionally produced video that doesnâ€™t connect as strongly.Â </div><h2>Video and current consumers have become intertwined</h2><div class="paragraph">Since video plays such a large role in the lives of current consumers, the behavior and expectation of consumers should be taken into consideration for every marketing campaign. As current generations prefer a more authentic experience, it is crucial to adopt growth marketing practices now more than ever.</div>]]></content:encoded>

<p><strong><a href="https://bitcompare.net/coins/bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></strong>&nbsp;is taking a lot of hits lately from notable individuals and mainstream media. But it appears this is happening due to â€œmisplacedâ€ reasons. They have been trying to portray Bitcoin mining as â€œclimate unfriendly.â€</p>
<p>\
Anyone who understands Bitcoin to the core would know this attack is unfounded. The publications claim other industries and activities are friendlier than Bitcoin mining. But the truth is, they have caused severe environmental damage for decades.</p>
<h2 id="doesmainstreammedianowreportfallacy"><strong>Does Mainstream Media Now Report Fallacy?</strong></h2>
<p>At exactly 11:00 EDT yesterday, major media outlets released exaggerated articles. They created these articles to discredit Bitcoin mining.</p>
<p>\
This occurred minutes after Benjamin Jones&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-18686-8">published his report</a> titled, â€œEconomic estimation of Bitcoin miningâ€™s climate damages demonstrates closer resemblance to digital crude than digital gold.â€</p>
<p>\
While the report questioned Bitcoinâ€™s climate friendliness, it presented biased facts. This puts a huge question mark on the authorâ€™s research and thought process while writing the report.</p>
<p>Following the reportâ€™s release, major media outlets published articles supporting the report. They include The Guardian,&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/roberthart/2022/09/29/bitcoins-environmental-damage-is-on-par-with-beef-natural-gas-and-oil-study-suggests/?utm_campaign=forbes&utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_term=Gordie&sh=1cf067922a11">Forbes</a></strong>, and, The Verge. The truth is, anyone who understands Bitcoin will see the PR stunt pulled by these outlets.</p>
<p>\
They were all stating similar stuff indicating that Bitcoinâ€™s climate impact is much greater or equal to gold mining, beef, and crude oil, which were termed â€œbad.â€</p>
<p>\
However, this is a deliberate action by some journalists to tarnish the image of Bitcoin. We also believe that most, if not all their facts, were not properly researched. We will be shedding more light on this.</p>
<h2 id="bitcoinvsbeef"><strong>Bitcoin vs. Beef</strong></h2>
<p>In one of the pieces published by Alex Hern in&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/sep/29/bitcoin-climate-impact-gold-mining-environmental-damage-cryptocurrency">The Guardian</a></strong>, it states that,</p>
<p>\</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>â€œBitcoin is less digital gold and more digital beef.â€</p>
</blockquote>
<p>\
The article implied beef production had as much environmental damage as the market it supports. According to them, the damage estimation is at 33%.</p>
<p>\
They went on to apply this concept to Bitcoin. While doing this, the author stated that the climate damage from Bitcoin production had averaged 35% in the past five years. He also said the damage was at its peak in 2020, averaging&nbsp; 82%.</p>
<p>\
Though Bitcoin operates on the PoW system, it is more energy efficient than the classical system. Studies have shown that&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-uses-less-than-50-banking-energy">Bitcoin uses 50 times less energy</a></strong>&nbsp;than traditional banking. Even at the single transaction level, it is one to five times energy efficient.</p>
<p>\
 <img src="https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/C1NMxASo99bwSkaydbB9HmaaIYz1-2022-10-04T23:25:28.645Z-cl8utwsee000u0as6ag94gx4p" alt="" /></p>
<p>Graph showing Bitcoin Carbon Emissions Compared to Other Industries; Photo Source: Messari</p>
<p>It is ignorant to say that a cryptocurrency supporting decentralization is harmful. Bitcoin has eliminated the complexities of the traditional system. Is Bitcoin also harmful by helping to ease transactions?</p>
<p>\
We may not be shocked that Alex is unaware of traditional banking's energy profile. Studies show that these systems have an&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/cryptocurrency/articles/bitcoin-uses-50-times-less-energy-than-traditional-banking-new-study-shows/">annual energy profile</a></strong>&nbsp;of 4,981 TWh. Bitcoin has only 89TWH. Look at such a difference.</p>
<h2 id="whendidoilexplorationbecomeecofriendlierthanbitcoinmining"><strong>When Did Oil Exploration Become Eco-friendlier Than Bitcoin Mining?</strong></h2>
<p>Comparing Bitcoin mining energy consumption with gold mining is ridiculous. And so is saying it has more negative impact than crude oil. The use of natural gas poses 46% of climate damage on an annual basis. So, calling Bitcoin an energy glutton is utterly non-factual.</p>
<p>\
The&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/29/23378337/bitcoin-climate-change-damages-crypto-mining">Verge articleâ€™s</a></strong>&nbsp;title also said, â€œBitcoinâ€™s climate damage is similar to beef and crude oil.â€ This is another of the many fallacious statements drawn from Benjaminâ€™s report.</p>
<p>\
Now, let's bring the facts to the table. We will highlight the environmental degradation of a mentioned industry: oil exploration.</p>
<p>\
Benjamin Jones could try to get better facts by researching or visiting areas devastated by oil exploration. Good examples are the Niger Delta region of Nigeria and other African countries. The facts are not hidden and&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/353842091_Crude_oil_exploration_in_Africa_socio-economic_implications_environmental_impacts_and_mitigation_strategies">research reports</a></strong>&nbsp;can prove this.</p>
<p>\
Then, he could compare if the impact of Bitcoin mining is worse than the lost means of livelihood. The mentioned regions have become nearly uninhabitable and lack access to drinking water.</p>
<p>\
There is also a growing rate of lung cancer caused by the inhalation of soot from gas flaring, and it causes death. These are to mention a few impacts.</p>

<p>Benjaminâ€™s report talks about the environmental costs of Bitcoin. But, the damage done by oil exploration over the decades will take hundreds of billions of dollars to fix. How about the lost lives? No amount of money can bring them back.</p>
<p>\
Or maybe, humans stopped becoming a part of the environment since his report conveniently missed the above-stated facts.</p>
<p>\
Should we also forget the fact that oil exploration also puts money only into the pockets of the few oil multinationals and their billionaire owners? Bitcoin mining and other activities related to Bitcoin have decentralized wealth generation.</p>
<h2 id="theneedforfactualbitcoinandcryptojournalism"><strong>The Need For Factual Bitcoin and Crypto Journalism</strong></h2>
<p>The real facts about the impact of gold mining and beef production are there for everyone to see. Media outlets should avoid creating hyperbolic reports and articles to discredit Bitcoin mining.</p>
<p>\
One could say that the report and publications are â€œjournalism with misplaced priorities.â€ And supporting biased publications makes them appear less credible.</p>

<p>\
Have you ever heard about entropy?</p>
<p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5f59f5829ccb43e646633b1d/632b15ce3048d056d435a52e_Have%20you%20ever%20heard%20about%20ntropy_.svg" alt="" /></p>
<p>As Stephen Hawking framed it:</p>
<p>\</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>You may see a cup of tea fall off a table and break into pieces on the floorâ€¦ But you will never see the cup gather itself back together and jump back on the table. The increase of disorder, or entropy, is what distinguishes the past from the future, giving a direction to time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>\
In other words:&nbsp; <strong>things will fall apart eventually when unattended</strong>.</p>
<p>\
But letâ€™s not get too depressed or comfortable with things just turning into chaos naturally. We can and do fight back against it. We can exert effort to create useful types of order resilient enough to withstand the unrelenting pull of entropy by expending energy.</p>
<p>\
Letâ€™s start from the beginning.</p>
<h2 id="whatdoesadevelopmentcyclelooklike">What Does a Development Cycle Look Like?</h2>
<p>When developing software, we feel entropy. Thatâ€™s why we usually put extra effort into following some development cycle.</p>
<p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5f59f5829ccb43e646633b1d/632b168d898b2b103b53ecef_How%20does%20a%20development%20cycle%20look%20like_.svg" alt="" /></p>
<p>For example, we start with adding a new feature. During development, we sprinkle it with a bunch of tests. When weâ€™re done, we send it to QAs. They accept it and promote our code to a production release channel. And weâ€™re back to adding another feature.</p>
<p>\
Thatâ€™s quite a simplified version of what we usually do. Because, among other things, <strong>we donâ€™t take into account that wild bugs may appear!</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5f59f5829ccb43e646633b1d/632b16d4f8960e87dc8458d3_2%20-%20How%20does%20a%20development%20cycle%20look%20like_.svg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Our experience tells us to keep it cool, identify the root cause, and <strong>add a regression test</strong> so it never breaks again. Then we send it to QA once again, ship it, and go back to adding features.</p>
<p>\
Weâ€™re happier with our workflow now; it works well. Weâ€™re adding feature after feature. Our app release cycle is so well designed that even adding ten new developers doesnâ€™t slow us down. Until we take a look at our app reviews:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/KJ3mcmAxpUWXf6w3bdTX8dtvKJH2-2022-10-04T23:20:31.180Z-cl8utqevg000p0as6h8q3h3mw" alt="" /></p>
<h2 id="whydoyouneedtocontinuouslymonitortheperformanceofyourapp">Why Do You Need to Continuously Monitor the Performance of Your App?</h2>
<p>We realize that our perfect workflow based on Scienceâ„¢, our experience, and â€œbest practices,â€ which were supposed to prevent our app from falling apart, is not resilient to particular bugs. Namely, <strong>performance regressions.</strong></p>
<p>\
Our codebase doesnâ€™t have the tools to fight these. We know how to fix the issues once spotted, but <strong>we have no way to spot them before they hit our users.</strong></p>
<p>\
Coming back to our entropy example, in other words, we could say that performance will fall apart eventually when unattended. <strong>If we donâ€™t do anything to optimize our app</strong> while adding new code and letting the time go by, <strong>it will certainly get slower.</strong></p>
<p>\
We donâ€™t know when it will happen. Maybe tomorrow, maybe in a week, or a year.</p>
<p>If only thereâ€™s been an established way of catching some of the regressions early in the development processâ€¦</p>
<p>\
Wait a minute, there is!</p>
<h2 id="howtomonitorappperformanceregression">How to Monitor App Performance Regression?</h2>
<p>With fully automated regression tests! Tests that run in a remote environment on every code change, and that already are a part of our development process.</p>
<p>\
Before we pick the best tool for the job, letâ€™s consider the impact and whatâ€™s worth testing.</p>
<h3 id="themostcommonreactnativeperformanceissues">The Most Common React (Native) Performance Issues</h3>
<p>As with test coverage, thereâ€™s a healthy ratio that we strive for to provide us with the best value for the lowest amount of effort. We want to target regressions that are most likely to hit our users.</p>
<p>\
At <a href="https://www.callstack.com/">Callstack</a>, we identified React Native performance issues our developers deal with daily.</p>
<p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5f59f5829ccb43e646633b1d/632b18e06487296e8a03b010_performance%20issues%20(1).svg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Slow lists and images, SVGs, React Context misusage, re-renders, and slow TTI, are among the most common ones. If we look at this list from the origin of the issue point of view, weâ€™ll notice that a vast majority of these come from the JS side.</p>
<p>\
We estimate that most of the time our developers spend fixing performance issues, around <strong>80%, originates from the JS realm, especially from React misusage.</strong> Only the rest is bridge communication overhead and native code â€“ like image rendering or database operations â€“ working inefficiently.</p>
<p>\
Itâ€™s fair to say that we expect to encounter these problems in both React web apps and React Native mobile apps.</p>
<p>\
We did our research and didnâ€™t find any library allowing us to reliably write performance regression tests for React or React Native. Weâ€™d like to have it integrated with the existing ecosystem of libraries weâ€™re using.</p>
<p>\
The perfect library for measuring performance regression should:</p>
<p>\</p>
<ul>
<li>measure render times and count reliably,</li>
<li>have a CI runner,</li>
<li>generate readable and parseable reports,</li>
<li>provide helpful insights for code review, and</li>
<li>have a stable design based on React public API.</li>
</ul>
<p>\
Using our experience from developing the <a href="https://callstack.github.io/react-native-testing-library/">React Native Testing Library</a>, we created <strong><a href="https://www.callstack.com/open-source/reassure">Reassure</a>â€”a performance regression testing companion for React and React Native components.</strong> We developed it in partnership with <a href="https://entaingroup.com/">Entain</a> â€“ one of the worldâ€™s largest sports betting and gaming groups.</p>
<h2 id="howdoesreassurework">How Does Reassure Work?</h2>
<p>Reassure builds on top of your existing React Testing Library setup and sprinkles it with an unobtrusive performance measurement API.</p>
<p>\
Itâ€™s designed to be <strong>run on a remote server environment</strong> as a part of your continuous integration suite.</p>
<p>\
To increase the stability of results and decrease flakiness, Reassure will run your tests once for the current branch and another for the base branch.</p>
<p>\
In the near future, with sufficiently stable CI, weâ€™ll be able only to run the tests once and compare the results with the ones from the past.</p>
<p>\
To ensure a delightful Developer Experience, Reassure <strong>integrates with GitHub to enhance the code review process</strong>. Currently, we leverage Danger.js as our bot backend, but in the future, weâ€™d like to prepare a plug-and-play GitHub Action.</p>
<p>\
Letâ€™s take a look at what it takes to incorporate Reassure into your regression testing pipeline.</p>
<h3 id="writeperformanceregressiontests">Write Performance Regression Tests</h3>
<p>Before you write your first test, you need to install Reassure:</p>
<p>\</p>
<pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">yarn add --dev reassure
# or 
npm install --save-dev reassure
</code></pre>
<p>\
Now, you can start writing your performance tests. Letâ€™s take a look at this example:</p>
<p>\</p>
<pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">// counter.perf-test.tsx
test('Count increments on press', async () =&gt; {
  const scenario = async (screen: RenderAPI) =&gt; {
    const button = screen.getByText('Action');

    await screen.findByText('Count: 0â€™);
    fireEvent.press(button);
    fireEvent.press(button);
    await screen.findByText('Count: 2');
  };

  const stats = await measurePerformance(
    &lt;Counter /&gt;, 
    { scenario, runs: 20 }
  );
await writeTestStats(stats);
});
</code></pre>
<p>\
We created a new file with the â€œ.perf-test.tsxâ€ extension that reuses our component test in a <code>scenario</code> function. It takes an optional <code>screen</code> argument which is, in fact, a return value of Testing Libraryâ€™s <code>render</code> helper.</p>
<p>\
The scenario is then used by the <code>measurePerformance</code> method from Reassure, which renders our Counter component, in this case, 20 times, letting the React Profiler measure render count and duration times for us. In the end, we call <code>writeTestStats</code> to save this data to the filesystem.</p>
<p>\
And thatâ€™s usually all you have to write. Copy-paste your existing tests, adjust, and enjoy your app being a little bit safer with every test.</p>
<h3 id="runreassure">Run Reassure</h3>
<p>Now that you have your first performance regression test created, itâ€™s time to run Reassure somehow! Itâ€™s important to mention that you need to measure the performance of two versions of your code â€“ the current (modified one) and the baseline. Reassure will compare the two to determine whether there are any regressions in the current code version.</p>
<p>\
Since the goal is to run the performance tests on the CI environment, we want to automate this task. To do that, you will need to create a performance testing script, like this one:</p>
<p>\</p>
<pre><code class="javascript language-javascript"># Gather baseline perf measurements
git switch main
yarn install --force
yarn reassure --baseline

# Gather current perf measurements &amp; compare results
git switch -
yarn install --force
yarn reassure
</code></pre>
<p>\
And save it in your repository, e.g., as <code>reassure-tests.sh</code> .</p>
<p>\
The script switches to your base branch, installs dependencies, and runs <code>yarn reassure --baseline</code> to gather the base metrics. Once done, it switches back to your current feature branch, installs dependencies again, as those might have changed, and runs <code>yarn reassure</code> again.</p>
<h3 id="seetheperformancetestresults">See the Performance Test Results</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/KJ3mcmAxpUWXf6w3bdTX8dtvKJH2-2022-10-04T23:20:31.187Z-cl8utqevn000s0as63ome46mz" alt="" /></p>
<p>Having all that data, Reassure can present the render duration times as statistically significant or meaningless.</p>
<p>\
Apart from render times, another useful metric that may easily degrade is render counts, which we get for free from React Profiler.</p>
<p>\
All this information is stored in a JSON format for further analysis and Markdown for readability.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/KJ3mcmAxpUWXf6w3bdTX8dtvKJH2-2022-10-04T23:20:31.186Z-cl8utqevm000r0as64n1b2myt" alt="" /></p>
<p>We use the markdown output as a source for the GitHub commenting bot powered by <a href="https://danger.systems/js/">DangerJS</a>.</p>
<p>\
This is by far our favorite and recommended usage of this tool, as it enriches the code review process while allowing us to alleviate the instability of the CI weâ€™re using.</p>
<h2 id="whathavewelearnedfromdevelopingreassure">What Have We Learned From Developing Reassure?</h2>
<p>Developing Reassure has taught us some valuable lessons about</p>
<p>\</p>
<ul>
<li>running benchmarks with Node.js, and</li>
<li>measuring precision in JavaScript.</li>
</ul>
<p>\
Letâ€™s dive into it!</p>
<h3 id="challengesofrunningbenchmarkswithnodejs">Challenges of Running Benchmarks With Node.js</h3>
<p>Running benchmarks is not a piece of cake even in non-JS environments, but itâ€™s <strong>particularly tricky with Node.js</strong>.</p>
<p>\
The key is <strong>embracing stability and avoiding flakiness</strong>. Operating in a JavaScript VM, we need to considerJIT, garbage collection, and module resolution caching.</p>
<p>\
Then we have a cost of concurrency that our test runner embraces for execution speed. We need to pick what to average, what to percentile, and how to apply statistical analysis. And a lot more.</p>
<p>\
Running tests once or twice is not enough to make sure our measurement results make sense mathematically. Taking other things into account, ten times is a good baseline for our use case.</p>
<p>\
Then to determine the probability of the result being statistically significant, we need to calculate the z-score, which needs the mean value (or average), divergence, and standard deviation.</p>
<p>\
Reassure handles all of that for you, so you donâ€™t even have to think about it.</p>
<h3 id="whatyouprobablydidntknowaboutmeasurementprecisioninjavascript">What You Probably Didnâ€™t Know About Measurement Precision in JavaScript</h3>
<p>Measurement precision is another tricky topic in the JS land.</p>
<p>\
React Profiler uses <code>performance.now()</code> API to reliably measure rendering time. Node.js implements the W3C recommendation, whichâ€”due to privacy concernsâ€”requires a resolution of no less than 5 microseconds.</p>
<p>\
We can measure a 1 ms render with at least 0.5% error. This is usually good enough. But because many lighter components render faster than 1 ms, and due to the variable stability of the machine, we run them at least ten times anyway and let you configure that as well.</p>
<p>\
Now, module resolution caching is great for our Node.js apps.</p>
<p>\
But it bothered us when developing the library. As it turned out, <strong>subsequent execution of the same component often resulted in even ten times slower runs.</strong> As you can imagine, averaging that would make the results unreliable. So we drop the slowest test as most likely itâ€™s skewed by the lack of cache.</p>
<h2 id="wrappingup">Wrapping Up</h2>
<p>Even if you donâ€™t have performance issues at the moment, they will appear sooner or later. We speak from our experience with many clients. Reassure will allow you to spot them once they appear.</p>
<p>\
With Reassure, you can</p>
<p>\</p>
<ul>
<li><p>test whole screens or even screen sequences</p></li>
<li><p>perform component level tests are possible but often require more runs</p></li>
<li><p>reuse your RNTL tests if you have them, and</p></li>
<li><p>all established Testing Library practices apply, so let your tests resemble usersâ€™ behavior and avoid mocking anything other than I/O.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/KJ3mcmAxpUWXf6w3bdTX8dtvKJH2-2022-10-04T23:20:31.185Z-cl8utqevl000q0as6ekbuc39l" alt="" /></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Due to their qualities, frontend perf tests seem to resemble end-to-end tests for our apps. And it makes sense to treat them as such in our testing trophies or pyramids.</p>
<p>\
Remember that performance is not a goal. Itâ€™s a path. Walk it with confidence.</p>
<h2 id="reassureisopensource">Reassure Is Open Source</h2>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://goreleaser.com/">Goreleaser</a> is awesome. It's a simple tool that allows you to release your <em>go</em> packages. Recently, my team and I used it with a company-wide CLI tool that we built.</p>
<p>\
In this tutorial, we'll use <em>goreleaser</em> to automate the release of a simple <code>go</code> package.</p>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>On macOS, to install <em>goreleaser</em>, we can install using:</p>
<pre><code>go install github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser@latest
</code></pre>
<p>\
Or we use the popular <em><a href="https://brew.sh/">homebrew</a></em> package manager for macOS and Linux with:</p>
<pre><code>brew install goreleaser/tap/goreleaser
</code></pre>
<p>\
On Ubuntu Linux, we can use <code>apt</code>:</p>
<pre><code>echo 'deb [trusted=yes] https://repo.goreleaser.com/apt/ /' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/goreleaser.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt install goreleaser
</code></pre>
<p>\
More options can be found <a href="https://goreleaser.com/install/">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="createpackage">Create Package</h2>
<p>Create a new folder to house our project. Then initialize the modules with:</p>
<pre><code>go mod init main 
</code></pre>
<p>\
Next, we create a file called <code>main.go</code>. In <code>main.go</code>, copy and paste the following code:</p>
<pre><code class="go language-go">package main

func main() {
  println("This is a tutorial about Goreleaser!")
}
</code></pre>
<h2 id="initializegoreleaser">Initialize Goreleaser</h2>
<p>The next step is to set up <em>goreleaser</em>. To do this, we run:</p>
<pre><code>goreleaser init
</code></pre>
<p>This command creates the<code>.goreleaser.yaml</code> file in our directory. We'll take a closer look at this file.</p>
<h2 id="updategoreleaseryaml">Update <code>.goreleaser.yaml</code></h2>
<p>I have added a few more fields to the generated <code>.goreleaser.yaml</code> file. We'll go through the important parts.</p>
<pre><code class="yaml language-yaml">release:
  github:
    owner: justdamilare
    name: mytool

before:
  hooks:
    - go mod tidy
    - go generate ./...

    folder: "{{ .Version }}"

# generate homebrew-tap  
brews:
  - name: justdamilare
    tap:
      owner: mytool
      name: homebrew-tap
    folder: Formula
    homepage: https://github.com/justdamilare/mytool
    description: A simple go project
    # use custom download strategy in case the Github repository is private
    download_strategy: GitHubPrivateRepositoryReleaseDownloadStrategy
    custom_require: "../custom_download_strategy"
    test: |
      system "#{bin}/mytool"
    install: |
      bin.install "mytool"
</code></pre>
<p>\
It should be noted that if <code>homebrew-tap</code> and <code>blobs</code> are not needed, the sections can be removed. If <code>homebrew-tap</code> is needed, a GitHub repo called <code>homebrew-tap</code> should be created also.</p>
<h2 id="releasepackage">Release Package</h2>
<p>Finally, we can release our packages. To do that, we need to create a tag for our release on Git. For example, to create a tag for version <code>0.1.0</code>, we can run:</p>
<pre><code>git tag v0.1.0
</code></pre>
<p>\
and</p>
<pre><code>git push origin v0.1.0
</code></pre>
<p>\
Then in the directory with <code>main.go</code>, run:</p>
<pre><code>goreleaser release
</code></pre>
<p>\
Goreleaser will build all the binaries. These binaries will be uploaded automatically to Github using the local GitHub credentials. The builds will also be located in a <code>/dist</code> folder in the home directory.</p>
<p>\
If the <code>brew</code> publish method is included, a generated <code>*.rb</code> file will also be in the <code>/dist</code> folder. In case Goreleaser does not copy the generated <code>Formula</code> to the <code>homebrew-tap</code> repo automatically, it can be copied manually.</p>
<p>\
You can see how to publish the build to a private homebrew-tap <a href="https://blog.devgenius.io/create-homebrew-taps-for-private-github-repos-44daf2f4cff8">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li>Install goreleaser</li>
<li>Create <em>go</em> package</li>
<li>Initialize Goreleaser with <code>goreleaser init</code></li>
<li>Update <code>.goreleaser.yaml</code></li>
<li>Release build by creating a tag with <code>git tag vX.X.X</code> and then run <code>goreleaser release</code></li>

The table of Links for this book can be found </em><a href="https://app.hackernoon.com/drafts/Ov3ZPT2pkr2Bwi65Lbet"><em>here</em></a><em>. History of the Moral Feelings </em></div><div class="paragraph">
</div><h2>HISTORY OF THE MORAL FEELINGS</h2><div class="paragraph"><strong>35</strong></div><div class="paragraph"><strong>Advantages of Psychological Observation.</strong>â€”That reflection regarding the human, all-too-humanâ€”or as the learned jargon is: psychological observationâ€”is among the means whereby the burden of life can be made lighter, that practice in this art affords presence of mind in difficult situations and entertainment amid a wearisome environment, aye, that maxims may be culled in the thorniest and least pleasing paths of life and invigoration thereby obtained: this much was believed, was knownâ€”in former centuries. Why was this forgotten in our own century, during which, at least in Germany, yes in Europe, poverty as regards psychological observation would have been manifest in many ways had there been anyone to whom this poverty could have manifested itself. Not only in the novel, in the romance, in philosophical standpointsâ€”these are the works of exceptional men; still more in the state of opinion regarding public events and personages; above all in general society, which says much about men but nothing whatever about man, there is totally lacking the art of psychological analysis and synthesis. </div><div class="paragraph">But why is the richest and most harmless source of entertainment thus allowed to run to waste? Why is the greatest master of the psychological maxim no longer read?â€”for, with no exaggeration whatever be it said: the educated person in Europe who has read La Rochefoucauld and his intellectual and artistic affinities is very hard to find; still harder, the person who knows them and does not disparage them. Apparently, too, this unusual reader takes far less pleasure in them than the form adopted by these artists should afford him: for the subtlest mind cannot adequately appreciate the art of maxim-making unless it has had training in it, unless it has competed in it. Without such practical acquaintance, one is apt to look upon this making and forming as a much easier thing than it really is; one is not keenly enough alive to the felicity and the charm of success. Hence present day readers of maxims have but a moderate, tempered pleasure in them, scarcely, indeed, a true perception of their merit, so that their experiences are about the same as those of the average beholder of cameos: people who praise because they cannot appreciate, and are very ready to admire and still readier to turn away.</div><div class="paragraph"><strong>36</strong></div><div class="paragraph"><strong>Objection.</strong>â€”Or is there a counter-proposition to the dictum that psychological observation is one of the means of consoling, lightening, charming existence? Have enough of the unpleasant effects of this art been experienced to justify the person striving for culture in turning his regard away from it? In all truth, a certain blind faith in the goodness of human nature, an implanted distaste for any disparagement of human concerns, a sort of shamefacedness at the nakedness of the soul, may be far more desirable things in the general happiness of a man, than this only occasionally advantageous quality of psychological sharpsightedness; and perhaps belief in the good, in virtuous men and actions, in a plenitude of disinterested benevolence has been more productive of good in the world of men in so far as it has made men less distrustful. </div><div class="paragraph">If Plutarch&#x27;s heroes are enthusiastically imitated and a reluctance is experienced to looking too critically into the motives of their actions, not the knowledge but the welfare of human society is promoted thereby: psychological error and above all obtuseness in regard to it, help human nature forward, whereas knowledge of the truth is more promoted by means of the stimulating strength of a hypothesis; as La RochefoucauldÂ in the first edition of his &quot;Sentences and Moral Maxims&quot; has expressed it: &quot;What the world calls virtue is ordinarily but a phantom created by the passions, and to which we give a good name in order to do whatever we please with impunity.&quot; La Rochefoucauld and those other French masters of soul-searching (to the number of whom has lately been added a German, the author of &quot;Psychological Observations&quot;) are like expert marksmen who again and again hit the black spotâ€”but it is the black spot in human nature. Their art inspires amazement, but finally some spectator, inspired, not by the scientific spirit but by a humanitarian feeling, execrates an art that seems to implant in the soul a taste for belittling and impeaching mankind.</div><div class="paragraph"><strong>37</strong></div><div class="paragraph"><strong>Nevertheless.</strong>â€”The matter therefore, as regards pro and con, stands thus: in the present state of philosophy an awakening of the moral observation is essential. The repulsive aspect of psychological dissection, with the knife and tweezers entailed by the process, can no longer be spared humanity. Such is the imperative duty of any science that investigates the origin and history of the so-called moral feelings andÂ which, in its progress, is called upon to posit and to solve advanced social problems:â€”The older philosophy does not recognize the newer at all and, through paltry evasions, has always gone astray in the investigation of the origin and history of human estimates (WerthschÃ¤tzungen). With what results may now be very clearly perceived, since it has been shown by many examples, how the errors of the greatest philosophers have their origin in a false explanation of certain human actions and feelings; how upon the foundation of an erroneous analysis (for example, of the so called disinterested actions), a false ethic is reared, to support which religion and like mythological monstrosities are called in, until finally the shades of these troubled spirits collapse in physics and in the comprehensive world point of view. </div><div class="paragraph">But if it be established that superficiality of psychological observation has heretofore set the most dangerous snares for human judgment and deduction, and will continue to do so, all the greater need is there of that steady continuance of labor that never wearies putting stone upon stone, little stone upon little stone; all the greater need is there of a courage that is not ashamed of such humble labor and that will oppose persistence, to all contempt. It is, finally, also true that countless single observations concerning the human, all-too-human,Â have been first made and uttered in circles accustomed, not to furnish matter for scientific knowledge, but for intellectual pleasure-seeking; and the original home atmosphereâ€”a very seductive atmosphereâ€”of the moral maxim has almost inextricably interpenetrated the entire species, so that the scientific man involuntarily manifests a sort of mistrust of this species and of its seriousness. But it is sufficient to point to the consequences: for already it is becoming evident that events of the most portentous nature are developing in the domain of psychological observation. What is the leading conclusion arrived at by one of the subtlest and calmest of thinkers, the author of the work &quot;Concerning the Origin of the Moral Feelings&quot;, as a result of his thorough and incisive analysis of human conduct? &quot;The moral man,&quot; he says, &quot;stands no nearer the knowable (metaphysical) world than the physical man.&quot;<a></a><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38145/38145-h/38145-h.htm#Footnote_19_19">19</a>Â This dictum, grown hard and cutting beneath the hammer-blow of historical knowledge, can some day, perhaps, in some future or other, serve as the axe that will be laid to the root of the &quot;metaphysical necessities&quot; of menâ€”whether more to the blessing than to the banning of universal wellÂ being who can say?â€”but in any event a dictum fraught with the most momentous consequences, fruitful and fearful at once, and confronting the world in the two faced way characteristic of all great facts.</div><div class="paragraph"><a></a><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38145/38145-h/38145-h.htm#FNanchor_19_19">19</a>&quot;Der moralische Mensch, sagt er, steht der intelligiblen (metaphysischen) Welt nicht nÃ¤her, als der physische Mensch.&quot;</div><div class="paragraph"><strong>38</strong></div><div class="paragraph"><strong>To What Extent Useful.</strong>â€”Therefore, whether psychological observation is more an advantage than a disadvantage to mankind may always remain undetermined: but there is no doubt that it is necessary, because science can no longer dispense with it. Science, however, recognizes no considerations of ultimate goals or ends any more than nature does; but as the latter duly matures things of the highest fitness for certain ends without any intention of doing it, so will true science, doing with ideas what nature does with matter,<a></a><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38145/38145-h/38145-h.htm#Footnote_20_20">20</a>Â promote the purposes and the welfare of humanity, (as occasion may afford, and in many ways) and attain fitness [to ends]â€”but likewise without having intended it.</div><div class="paragraph"><a></a><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38145/38145-h/38145-h.htm#FNanchor_20_20">20</a>als die Nachahmung der Natur in Begriffen, literally: &quot;as the counterfeit of nature in (regard to) ideas.&quot;</div><div class="paragraph">He to whom the atmospheric conditions of such a prospect are too wintry, has too little fire in him: let him look about him, and he willÂ become sensible of maladies requiring an icy air, and of people who are so &quot;kneaded together&quot; out of ardor and intellect that they can scarcely find anywhere an atmosphere too cold and cutting for them. Moreover: as too serious individuals and nations stand in need of trivial relaxations; as others, too volatile and excitable require onerous, weighty ordeals to render them entirely healthy: should not we, the more intellectual men of this age, which is swept more and more by conflagrations, catch up every cooling and extinguishing appliance we can find that we may always remain as self contained, steady and calm as we are now, and thereby perhaps serve this age as its mirror and self reflector, when the occasion arises?</div><div class="paragraph"><strong>39</strong></div><div class="paragraph"><strong>The Fable of Discretionary Freedom.</strong>â€”The history of the feelings, on the basis of which we make everyone responsible, hence, the so-called moral feelings, is traceable in the following leading phases. At first single actions are termed good or bad without any reference to their motive, but solely because of the utilitarian or prejudicial consequences they have for the community. In time, however, the origin of these designations is forgotten [but] it is imagined that action in itself, without reference to its consequences, contains the property &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot;: with the same error according to which language designates the stone itself as hard[ness] the tree itself as green[ness]â€”for the reason, therefore, that what is a consequence is comprehended as a cause. Accordingly, the good[ness] or bad[ness] is incorporated into the motive and [any] deed by itself is regarded as morally ambiguous. A step further is taken, and the predication good or bad is no longer made of the particular motives but of the entire nature of a man, out of which motive grows as grow the plants out of the soil. Thus man is successively made responsible for his [particular] acts, then for his [course of] conduct, then for his motives and finally for his nature. </div><div class="paragraph">Now, at last, is it discovered that this nature, even, cannot be responsible, inasmuch as it is only and wholly a necessary consequence and is synthesised out of the elements and influence of past and present things: therefore, that man is to be made responsible for nothing, neither for his nature, nor his motives, nor his [course of] conduct nor his [particular] acts. By this [process] is gained the knowledge that the history of moral estimates is the history of error, of the error of responsibility: as is whatever rests upon the error of the freedom of the will. SchopenhauerÂ concluded just the other way, thus: since certain actions bring depression (&quot;consciousness of guilt&quot;) in their train, there must, then, exist responsibility, for there would be no basis for this depression at hand if all man&#x27;s affairs did not follow their course of necessityâ€”as they do, indeed, according to the opinion of this philosopher, follow their courseâ€”but man himself, subject to the same necessity, would be just the man that he isâ€”which Schopenhauer denies. From the fact of such depression Schopenhauer believes himself able to prove a freedom which man in some way must have had, not indeed in regard to his actions but in regard to his nature: freedom, therefore, to be thus and so, not to act thus and so. </div><div class="paragraph">Out of theÂ esse, the sphere of freedom and responsibility, follows, according to his opinion, theÂ operari, the spheres of invariable causation, necessity and irresponsibility. This depression, indeed, is due apparently to theÂ operariâ€”in so far as it be delusiveâ€”but in truth to whateverÂ esseÂ be the deed of a free will, the basic cause of the existence of an individual: [in order to] let man become whatever he wills to become, his [to] will (Wollen) must precede his existence.â€”Here, apart from the absurdity of the statement just made, there is drawn the wrong inference that the fact of the depression explains its character, the rationalÂ admissibility of it: from such a wrong inference does Schopenhauer first come to his fantastic consequent of the so called discretionary freedom (intelligibeln Freiheit). (For the origin of this fabulous entity Plato and Kant are equally responsible). But depression after the act does not need to be rational: indeed, it is certainly not so at all, for it rests upon the erroneous assumption that the act need not necessarily have come to pass. Therefore: only because man deems himself free, but not because he is free, does he experience remorse and the stings of conscience.â€”Moreover, this depression is something that can be grown out of; in many men it is not present at all as a consequence of acts which inspire it in many other men. It is a very varying thing and one closely connected with the development of custom and civilization, and perhaps manifest only during a relatively brief period of the world&#x27;s history.â€”No one is responsible for his acts, no one for his nature; to judge is tantamount to being unjust. This applies as well when the individual judges himself. The proposition is as clear as sunlight, and yet here everyone prefers to go back to darkness and untruth: for fear of the consequences.</div><div class="paragraph"><strong>40</strong></div><div class="paragraph"><strong>Above Animal.</strong>â€”The beast in us must beÂ wheedled: ethic is necessary, that we may not be torn to pieces. Without the errors involved in the assumptions of ethics, man would have remained an animal. Thus has he taken himself as something higher and imposed rigid laws upon himself. He feels hatred, consequently, for states approximating the animal: whence the former contempt for the slave as a not-yet-man, as a thing, is to be explained.</div><div class="paragraph"><strong>41</strong></div><div class="paragraph"><strong>Unalterable Character.</strong>â€”That character is unalterable is not, in the strict sense, true; rather is this favorite proposition valid only to the extent that during the brief life period of a man the potent new motives can not, usually, press down hard enough to obliterate the lines imprinted by ages. Could we conceive of a man eighty thousand years old, we should have in him an absolutely alterable character; so that the maturities of successive, varying individuals would develop in him. The shortness of human life leads to many erroneous assertions concerning the qualities of man.</div><div class="paragraph"><strong>42</strong></div><div class="paragraph"><strong>Classification of Enjoyments and Ethic.</strong>â€”The once accepted comparative classificationÂ of enjoyments, according to which an inferior, higher, highest egoism may crave one or another enjoyment, now decides as to ethical status or unethical status. A lower enjoyment (for example, sensual pleasure) preferred to a more highly esteemed one (for example, health) rates as unethical, as does welfare preferred to freedom. The comparative classification of enjoyments is not, however, alike or the same at all periods; when anyone demands satisfaction of the law, he is, from the point of view of an earlier civilization, moral, from that of the present, non-moral. &quot;Unethical&quot; indicates, therefore, that a man is not sufficiently sensible to the higher, finer impulses which the present civilization has brought with it, or is not sensible to them at all; it indicates backwardness, but only from the point of view of the contemporary degree of distinction.â€”The comparative classification of enjoyments itself is not determined according to absolute ethics; but after each new ethical adjustment, it is then decided whether conduct be ethical or the reverse.</div><div class="paragraph"><strong>43</strong></div><div class="paragraph"><strong>Inhuman Men as Survivals.</strong>â€”Men who are now inhuman must serve us as surviving specimens of earlier civilizations. The mountain heightÂ of humanity here reveals its lower formations, which might otherwise remain hidden from view. There are surviving specimens of humanity whose brains through the vicissitudes of heredity, have escaped proper development. They show us what we all were and thus appal us; but they are as little responsible on this account as is a piece of granite for being granite. In our own brains there must be courses and windings corresponding to such characters, just as in the forms of some human organs there survive traces of fishhood. But these courses and windings are no longer the bed in which flows the stream of our feeling.</div><div class="paragraph"><strong>44</strong></div><div class="paragraph"><strong>Gratitude and Revenge.</strong>â€”The reason the powerful man is grateful is this. His benefactor has, through his benefaction, invaded the domain of the powerful man and established himself on an equal footing: the powerful man in turn invades the domain of the benefactor and gets satisfaction through the act of gratitude. It is a mild form of revenge. By not obtaining the satisfaction of gratitude the powerful would have shown himself powerless and have ranked as such thenceforward. Hence every society of the good, that is to say, of the powerful originally,Â places gratitude among the first of duties.â€”Swift has added the dictum that man is grateful in the same degree that he is revengeful.</div><div class="paragraph"><strong>45</strong></div><div class="paragraph"><strong>Two-fold Historical Origin of Good and Evil.</strong>â€”The notion of good and bad has a two-fold historical origin: namely, first, in the spirit of ruling races and castes. Whoever has power to requite good with good and evil with evil and actually brings requital, (that is, is grateful and revengeful) acquires the name of being good; whoever is powerless and cannot requite is called bad. A man belongs, as a good individual, to the &quot;good&quot; of a community, who have a feeling in common, because all the individuals are allied with one another through the requiting sentiment. A man belongs, as a bad individual, to the &quot;bad,&quot; to a mass of subjugated, powerless men who have no feeling in common. The good are a caste, the bad are a quantity, like dust. Good and bad is, for a considerable period, tantamount to noble and servile, master and slave. On the other hand an enemy is not looked upon as bad: he can requite. The Trojan and the Greek are in Homer both good. Not he, who does no harm, but he who is despised, is deemed bad. In the community of the good individuals [the quality of] good[ness] is inherited; it is impossible forÂ a bad individual to grow from such a rich soil. </div><div class="paragraph">If, notwithstanding, one of the good individuals does something unworthy of his goodness, recourse is had to exorcism; thus the guilt is ascribed to a deity, the while it is declared that this deity bewitched the good man into madness and blindness.â€”Second, in the spirit of the subjugated, the powerless. Here every other man is, to the individual, hostile, inconsiderate, greedy, inhuman, avaricious, be he noble or servile; bad is the characteristic term for man, for every living being, indeed, that is recognized at all, even for a god: human, divine, these notions are tantamount to devilish, bad. Manifestations of goodness, sympathy, helpfulness, are regarded with anxiety as trickiness, preludes to an evil end, deception, subtlety, in short, as refined badness. With such a predisposition in individuals, a feeling in common can scarcely arise at all, at most only the rudest form of it: so that everywhere that this conception of good and evil prevails, the destruction of the individuals, their race and nation, is imminent.â€”Our existing morality has developed upon the foundation laid by ruling races and castes.</div><div class="paragraph"><strong>46</strong></div><div class="paragraph"><strong>Sympathy Greater than Suffering.</strong>â€”There are circumstances in which sympathy is strongerÂ than the suffering itself. We feel more pain, for instance, when one of our friends becomes guilty of a reprehensible action than if we had done the deed ourselves. We once, that is, had more faith in the purity of his character than he had himself. Hence our love for him, (apparently because of this very faith) is stronger than is his own love for himself. If, indeed, his egoism really suffers more, as a result, than our egoism, inasmuch as he must take the consequences of his fault to a greater extent than ourselves, nevertheless, the unegoisticâ€”this word is not to be taken too strictly, but simply as a modified form of expressionâ€”in us is more affected by his guilt than the unegoistic in him.</div><div class="paragraph"><strong>47</strong></div><div class="paragraph"><strong>Hypochondria.</strong>â€”There are people who, from sympathy and anxiety for others become hypochondriacal. The resulting form of compassion is nothing else than sickness. So, also, is there a Christian hypochondria, from which those singular, religiously agitated people suffer who place always before their eyes the suffering and death of Christ.</div><div class="paragraph"><strong>48</strong></div><div class="paragraph"><strong>Economy of Blessings.</strong>â€”The advantageous and the pleasing, as the healthiest growths andÂ powers in the intercourse of men, are such precious treasures that it is much to be wished the use made of these balsamic means were as economical as possible: but this is impossible. Economy in the use of blessings is the dream of the craziest of Utopians.</div><div class="paragraph"><strong>49</strong></div><div class="paragraph"><strong>Well-Wishing.</strong>â€”Among the small, but infinitely plentiful and therefore very potent things to which science must pay more attention than to the great, uncommon things, well-wishing<a></a><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38145/38145-h/38145-h.htm#Footnote_21_21">21</a>Â must be reckoned; I mean those manifestations of friendly disposition in intercourse, that laughter of the eye, every hand pressure, every courtesy from which, in general, every human act gets its quality. Every teacher, every functionary adds this element as a gratuity to whatever he does as a duty; it is the perpetual well spring of humanity, like the waves of light in which everything grows; thus, in the narrowest circles, within the family, life blooms and flowers only through this kind feeling. The cheerfulness,Â friendliness and kindness of a heart are unfailing sources of unegoistic impulse and have made far more for civilization than those other more noised manifestations of it that are styled sympathy, benevolence and sacrifice. But it is customary to depreciate these little tokens of kindly feeling, and, indeed, there is not much of the unegoistic in them. The sum of these little doses is very great, nevertheless; their combined strength is of the greatest of strengths.â€”Thus, too, much more happiness is to be found in the world than gloomy eyes discover: that is, if the calculation be just, and all these pleasing moments in which every day, even the meanest human life, is rich, be not forgotten.</div><div class="paragraph"><a></a><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38145/38145-h/38145-h.htm#FNanchor_21_21">21</a>Wohl-wollen, kind feeling. It stands here for benevolence but not benevolence in the restricted sense of the word now prevailing.</div><div class="paragraph"><strong>50</strong></div><div class="paragraph"><strong>The Desire to Inspire Compassion.</strong>â€”La Rochefoucauld, in the most notable part of his self portraiture (first printed 1658) reaches the vital spot of truth when he warns all those endowed with reason to be on their guard against compassion, when he advises that this sentiment be left to men of the masses who stand in need of the promptings of the emotions (since they are not guided by reason) to induce them to give aid to the suffering and to be of service in misfortune:Â whereas compassion, in his (and Plato&#x27;s) view, deprives the heart of strength. To be sure, sympathy should be manifested but men should take care not to feel it; for the unfortunate are rendered so dull that the manifestation of sympathy affords them the greatest happiness in the world.â€”Perhaps a more effectual warning against this compassion can be given if this need of the unfortunate be considered not simply as stupidity and intellectual weakness, not as a sort of distraction of the spirit entailed by misfortune itself (and thus, indeed, does La Rochefoucauld seem to view it) but as something quite different and more momentous. </div><div class="paragraph">Let note be taken of children who cry and scream in order to be compassionated and who, therefore, await the moment when their condition will be observed; come into contact with the sick and the oppressed in spirit and try to ascertain if the wailing and sighing, the posturing and posing of misfortune do not have as end and aim the causing of pain to the beholder: the sympathy which each beholder manifests is a consolation to the weak and suffering only in as much as they are made to perceive that at least they have the power, notwithstanding all their weakness, to inflict pain. The unfortunate experiences a species of joy in the sense of superiority which the manifestation of sympathy entails; his imaginationis exalted; he is always strong enough, then, to cause the world pain. Thus is the thirst for sympathy a thirst for self enjoyment and at the expense of one&#x27;s fellow creatures: it shows man in the whole ruthlessness of his own dear self: not in his mere &quot;dullness&quot; as La Rochefoucauld thinks.â€”In social conversation three fourths of all the questions are asked, and three fourths of all the replies are made in order to inflict some little pain; that is why so many people crave social intercourse: it gives them a sense of their power. In these countless but very small doses in which the quality of badness is administered it proves a potent stimulant of life: to the same extent that well wishingâ€”(Wohl-wollen) distributed through the world in like manner, is one of the ever ready restoratives.â€”But will many honorable people be found to admit that there is any pleasure in administering pain? that entertainmentâ€”and rare entertainmentâ€”is not seldom found in causing others, at least in thought, some pain, and in raking them with the small shot of wickedness? The majority are too ignoble and a few are too good to know anything of this pudendum: the latter may, consequently, be prompt to deny that Prosper MÃ©rimÃ©e is right when he says: &quot;Know, also, that nothing is more common than to do wrong for the pleasure of doing it.&quot;</div><div class="paragraph"><strong>51</strong></div><div class="paragraph"><strong>How Appearance Becomes Reality.</strong>â€”The actor cannot, at last, refrain, even in moments of the deepest pain, from thinking of the effect produced by his deportment and by his surroundingsâ€”for example, even at the funeral of his own child: he will weep at his own sorrow and its manifestations as though he were his own audience. The hypocrite who always plays one and the same part, finally ceases to be a hypocrite; as in the case of priests who, when young men, are always, either consciously or unconsciously, hypocrites, and finally become naturally and then really, without affectation, mere priests: or if the father does not carry it to this extent, the son, who inherits his father&#x27;s calling and gets the advantage of the paternal progress, does. </div><div class="paragraph">When anyone, during a long period, and persistently, wishes to appear something, it will at last prove difficult for him to be anything else. The calling of almost every man, even of the artist, begins with hypocrisy, with an imitation of deportment, with a copying of the effective in manner. He who always wears the mask of a friendly man must at last gain a power over friendliness of disposition, without which the expression itself of friendliness is not to be gainedâ€”and finally friendliness of disposition gains the ascendancy over himâ€”heÂ isÂ benevolent.</div><div class="paragraph"><strong>52</strong></div><div class="paragraph"><strong>The Point of Honor in Deception.</strong>â€”In all great deceivers one characteristic is prominent, to which they owe their power. In the very act of deception, amid all the accompaniments, the agitation in the voice, the expression, the bearing, in the crisis of the scene, there comes over them a belief in themselves; this it is that acts so effectively and irresistibly upon the beholders. Founders of religions differ from such great deceivers in that they never come out of this state of self deception, or else they have, very rarely, a few moments of enlightenment in which they are overcome by doubt; generally, however, they soothe themselves by ascribing such moments of enlightenment to the evil adversary. Self deception must exist that both classes of deceivers may attain far reaching results. For men believe in the truth of all that is manifestly believed with due implicitness by others.</div><div class="paragraph"><strong>53</strong></div><div class="paragraph"><strong>Presumed Degrees of Truth.</strong>â€”One of the most usual errors of deduction is: because someone truly and openly is against us, therefore he speaks the truth. Hence the child has faith in the judgments of its elders, the Christian in theÂ assertions of the founder of the church. So, too, it will not be admitted that all for which men sacrificed life and happiness in former centuries was nothing but delusion: perhaps it is alleged these things were degrees of truth. But what is really meant is that, if a person sincerely believes a thing and has fought and died for his faith, it would be tooÂ unjustÂ if only delusion had inspired him. Such a state of affairs seems to contradict eternal justice. For that reason the heart of a sensitive man pronounces against his head the judgment: between moral conduct and intellectual insight there must always exist an inherent connection. It is, unfortunately, otherwise: for there is no eternal justice.</div><div class="paragraph"><strong>54</strong></div><div class="paragraph"><strong>Falsehood.</strong>â€”Why do men, as a rule, speak the truth in the ordinary affairs of life? Certainly not for the reason that a god has forbidden lying. But because first: it is more convenient, as falsehood entails invention, make-believe and recollection (wherefore Swift says that whoever invents a lie seldom realises the heavy burden he takes up: he must, namely, for every lie that he tells, insert twenty more). Therefore, because in plain ordinary relations of life it is expedient to say without circumlocution: I wantÂ this, I have done this, and the like; therefore, because the way of freedom and certainty is surer than that of ruse.â€”But if it happens that a child is brought up in sinister domestic circumstances, it will then indulge in falsehood as matter of course, and involuntarily say anything its own interests may prompt: an inclination for truth, an aversion to falsehood, is quite foreign and uncongenial to it, and hence it lies in all innocence.</div><div class="paragraph"><strong>55</strong></div><div class="paragraph"><strong>Ethic Discredited for Faith&#x27;s Sake.</strong>â€”No power can sustain itself when it is represented by mere humbugs: the Catholic Church may possess ever so many &quot;worldly&quot; sources of strength, but its true might is comprised in those still numberless priestly natures who make their lives stern and strenuous and whose looks and emaciated bodies are eloquent of night vigils, fasts, ardent prayer, perhaps even of whip lashes: these things make men tremble and cause them anxiety: what, if it be really imperative to live thus? This is the dreadful question which their aspect occasions. As they spread this doubt, they lay anew the prop of their power: even the free thinkers dare not oppose such disinterestedness with severe truth and cry: &quot;Thou deceived one,Â deceive not!&quot;â€”Only the difference of standpoint separates them from him: no difference in goodness or badness. But things we cannot accomplish ourselves, we are apt to criticise unfairly. Thus we are told of the cunning and perverted acts of the Jesuits, but we overlook the self mastery that each Jesuit imposes upon himself and also the fact that the easy life which the Jesuit manuals advocate is for the benefit, not of the Jesuits but the laity. Indeed, it may be questioned whether we enlightened ones would become equally competent workers as the result of similar tactics and organization, and equally worthy of admiration as the result of self mastery, indefatigable industry and devotion.</div><div class="paragraph"><strong>56</strong></div><div class="paragraph"><strong>Victory of Knowledge over Radical Evil.</strong>â€”It proves a material gain to him who would attain knowledge to have had during a considerable period the idea that mankind is a radically bad and perverted thing: it is a false idea, as is its opposite, but it long held sway and its roots have reached down even to ourselves and our present world. In order to understandÂ ourselvesÂ we must understandÂ it; but in order to attain a loftier height we must step above it. We then perceive that there is no such thing as sin in theÂ metaphysical sense: but also, in the same sense, no such thing as virtue; that this whole domain of ethical notions is one of constant variation; that there are higher and deeper conceptions of good and evil, moral and immoral. </div><div class="paragraph">Whoever desires no more of things than knowledge of them attains speedily to peace of mind and will at most err through lack of knowledge, but scarcely through eagerness for knowledge (or through sin, as the world calls it). He will not ask that eagerness for knowledge be interdicted and rooted out; but his single, all powerful ambition toÂ knowÂ as thoroughly and as fully as possible, will soothe him and moderate all that is strenuous in his circumstances. Moreover, he is now rid of a number of disturbing notions; he is no longer beguiled by such words as hell-pain, sinfulness, unworthiness: he sees in them merely the flitting shadow pictures of false views of life and of the world.</div><div class="paragraph"><strong>57</strong></div><div class="paragraph"><strong>Ethic as Man&#x27;s Self-Analysis.</strong>â€”A good author, whose heart is really in his work, wishes that someone would arise and wholly refute him if only thereby his subject be wholly clarified and made plain. The maid in love wishes that she could attest the fidelity of her own passionÂ through the faithlessness of her beloved. The soldier wishes to sacrifice his life on the field of his fatherland&#x27;s victory: for in the victory of his fatherland his highest end is attained. The mother gives her child what she deprives herself ofâ€”sleep, the best nourishment and, in certain circumstances, her health, her self.â€”But are all these acts unegoistic? Are these moral deeds miracles because they are, in Schopenhauer&#x27;s phrase &quot;impossible and yet accomplished&quot;? Is it not evident that in all four cases man loves one part of himself, (a thought, a longing, an experience) more than he loves another part of himself? that he thus analyses his being and sacrifices one part of it to another part? Is this essentially different from the behavior of the obstinate man who says &quot;I would rather be shot than go a step out of my way for this fellow&quot;?â€”Preference for something (wish, impulse, longing) is present in all four instances: to yield to it, with all its consequences, is not &quot;unegoistic.&quot;â€”In the domain of the ethical man conducts himself not as individuum but as dividuum.</div><div class="paragraph"><strong>58</strong></div><div class="paragraph"><strong>What Can be Promised.</strong>â€”Actions can be promised, but not feelings, for these are involuntary. Whoever promises somebody to loveÂ him always, or to hate him always, or to be ever true to him, promises something that it is out of his power to bestow. But he really can promise such courses of conduct as are the ordinary accompaniments of love, of hate, of fidelity, but which may also have their source in motives quite different: for various ways and motives lead to the same conduct. The promise to love someone always, means, consequently: as long as I love you, I will manifest the deportment of love; but if I cease to love you my deportment, although from some other motive, will be just the same, so that to the people about us it will seem as if my love remained unchanged.â€”Hence it is the continuance of the deportment of love that is promised in every instance in which eternal love (provided no element of self deception be involved) is sworn.</div><div class="paragraph"><strong>59</strong></div><div class="paragraph"><strong>Intellect and Ethic.</strong>â€”One must have a good memory to be able to keep the promises one makes. One must have a strong imagination in order to feel sympathy. So closely is ethics connected with intellectual capacity.</div><div class="paragraph"><strong>60</strong></div><div class="paragraph"><strong>Desire for Vengeance and Vengeance Itself.</strong>â€”To meditate revenge and attain it is tantamountÂ to an attack of fever, that passes away: but to meditate revenge without possessing the strength or courage to attain it is tantamount to suffering from a chronic malady, or poisoning of body and soul. Ethics, which takes only the motive into account, rates both cases alike: people generally estimate the first case as the worst (because of the consequences which the deed of vengeance may entail). Both views are short sighted.</div><div class="paragraph"><strong>61</strong></div><div class="paragraph"><strong>Ability to Wait.</strong>â€”Ability to wait is so hard to acquire that great poets have not disdained to make inability to wait the central motive of their poems. So Shakespeare in Othello, Sophocles in Ajax, whose suicide would not have seemed to him so imperative had he only been able to cool his ardor for a day, as the oracle foreboded: apparently he would then have repulsed somewhat the fearful whispers of distracted thought and have said to himself: Who has not already, in my situation, mistaken a sheep for a hero? is it so extraordinary a thing? On the contrary it is something universally human: Ajax should thus have soothed himself. Passion will not wait: the tragic element in the lives of great men does not generally consist in theirÂ conflict with time and the inferiority of their fellowmen but in their inability to put off their work a year or two: they cannot wait.â€”In all duels, the friends who advise have but to ascertain if the principals can wait: if this be not possible, a duel is rational inasmuch as each of the combatants may say: &quot;either I continue to live and the other dies instantly, or vice versa.&quot; To wait in such circumstances would be equivalent to the frightful martyrdom of enduring dishonor in the presence of him responsible for the dishonor: and this can easily cost more anguish than life is worth.</div><div class="paragraph"><strong>62</strong></div><div class="paragraph"><strong>Glutting Revenge.</strong>â€”Coarse men, who feel a sense of injury, are in the habit of rating the extent of their injury as high as possible and of stating the occasion of it in greatly exaggerated language, in order to be able to feast themselves on the sentiments of hatred and revenge thus aroused.</div><div class="paragraph"><strong>63</strong></div><div class="paragraph"><strong>Value of Disparagement.</strong>â€”Not a few, perhaps the majority of men, find it necessary, in order to retain their self esteem and a certainÂ uprightness in conduct, to mentally disparage and belittle all the people they know. But as the inferior natures are in the majority and as a great deal depends upon whether they retain or lose this uprightness, soâ€”</div><div class="paragraph"><strong>64</strong></div><div class="paragraph"><strong>The Man in a Rage.</strong>â€”We should be on our guard against the man who is enraged against us, as against one who has attempted our life, for the fact that we still live consists solely in the inability to kill: were looks sufficient, it would have been all up with us long since. To reduce anyone to silence by physical manifestations of savagery or by a terrorizing process is a relic of under civilization. So, too, that cold look which great personages cast upon their servitors is a remnant of the caste distinction between man and man; a specimen of rude antiquity: women, the conservers of the old, have maintained this survival, too, more perfectly than men.</div><div class="paragraph"><strong>65</strong></div><div class="paragraph"><strong>Whither Honesty May Lead.</strong>â€”Someone once had the bad habit of expressing himselfÂ upon occasion, and with perfect honesty, on the subject of the motives of his conduct, which were as good or as bad as the motives of all men. He aroused first disfavor, then suspicion, became gradually of ill repute and was pronounced a person of whom society should beware, until at last the law took note of such a perverted being for reasons which usually have no weight with it or to which it closes its eyes. Lack of taciturnity concerning what is universally held secret, and an irresponsible predisposition to see what no one wants to seeâ€”oneselfâ€”brought him to prison and to early death.</div><div class="paragraph"><strong>66</strong></div><div class="paragraph"><strong>Punishable, not Punished.</strong>â€”Our crime against criminals consists in the fact that we treat them as rascals.</div><div class="paragraph"><strong>67</strong></div><div class="paragraph"><strong>Sancta simplicitas of Virtue.</strong>â€”Every virtue has its privilege: for example, that of contributing its own little bundle of wood to the funeral pyre of one condemned.</div><div class="paragraph"><strong>68</strong></div><div class="paragraph"><strong>Morality and Consequence.</strong>â€”Not alone the beholders of an act generally estimate the ethical or unethical element in it by the result: no, the one who performed the act does the same. For the motives and the intentions are seldom sufficiently apparent, and amid them the memory itself seems to become clouded by the results of the act, so that a man often ascribes the wrong motives to his acts or regards the remote motives as the direct ones. Success often imparts to an action all the brilliance and honor of good intention, while failure throws the shadow of conscience over the most estimable deeds. Hence arises the familiar maxim of the politician: &quot;Give me only success: with it I can win all the noble souls over to my sideâ€”and make myself noble even in my own eyes.&quot;â€”In like manner will success prove an excellent substitute for a better argument. </div><div class="paragraph">To this very day many well educated men think the triumph of Christianity over Greek philosophy is a proof of the superior truth of the formerâ€”although in this case it was simply the coarser and more powerful that triumphed over the more delicate and intellectual. As regards superiority of truth, it is evident that because of it the reviving sciences have connected themselves, point for point, with the philosophy ofÂ Epicurus, while Christianity has, point for point, recoiled from it.</div><div class="paragraph"><strong>69</strong></div><div class="paragraph"><strong>Love and Justice.</strong>â€”Why is love so highly prized at the expense of justice and why are such beautiful things spoken of the former as if it were a far higher entity than the latter? Is the former not palpably a far more stupid thing than the latter?â€”Certainly, and on that very account so much the more agreeable to everybody: it is blind and has a rich horn of plenty out of which it distributes its gifts to everyone, even when they are unmerited, even when no thanks are returned. It is impartial like the rain, which according to the bible and experience, wets not alone the unjust but, in certain circumstances, the just as well, and to their skins at that.</div><div class="paragraph"><strong>70</strong></div><div class="paragraph"><strong>Execution.</strong>â€”How comes it that every execution causes us more pain than a murder? It is the coolness of the executioner, the painful preparation, the perception that here a man is being used as an instrument for the intimidation of others. For the guilt is not punished even if there be any: this is ascribable to the teachers,Â the parents, the environment, in ourselves, not in the murdererâ€”I mean the predisposing circumstances.</div><div class="paragraph"><strong>71</strong></div><div class="paragraph"><strong>Hope.</strong>â€”Pandora brought the box containing evils and opened it. It was the gift of the gods to men, a gift of most enticing appearance externally and called the &quot;box of happiness.&quot; Thereupon all the evils, (living, moving things) flew out: from that time to the present they fly about and do ill to men by day and night. One evil only did not fly out of the box: Pandora shut the lid at the behest of Zeus and it remained inside. Now man has this box of happiness perpetually in the house and congratulates himself upon the treasure inside of it; it is at his service: he grasps it whenever he is so disposed, for he knows not that the box which Pandora brought was a box of evils. Hence he looks upon the one evil still remaining as the greatest source of happinessâ€”it is hope.â€”Zeus intended that man, notwithstanding the evils oppressing him, should continue to live and not rid himself of life, but keep on making himself miserable. For this purpose he bestowed hope upon man: it is, in truth, the greatest of evils for it lengthens the ordeal of man.</div><div class="paragraph"><strong>72</strong></div><div class="paragraph"><strong>Degree of Moral Susceptibility Unknown.</strong>â€”The fact that one has or has not had certain profoundly moving impressions and insights into thingsâ€”for example, an unjustly executed, slain or martyred father, a faithless wife, a shattering, serious accident,â€”is the factor upon which the excitation of our passions to white heat principally depends, as well as the course of our whole lives. No one knows to what lengths circumstances (sympathy, emotion) may lead him. He does not know the full extent of his own susceptibility. Wretched environment makes him wretched. It is as a rule not the quality of our experience but its quantity upon which depends the development of our superiority or inferiority, from the point of view of good and evil.</div><div class="paragraph"><strong>73</strong></div><div class="paragraph"><strong>The Martyr Against His Will.</strong>â€”In a certain movement there was a man who was too cowardly and vacillating ever to contradict his comrades. He was made use of in each emergency, every sacrifice was demanded of him because he feared the disfavor of his comrades more than he feared death: he was a petty, abject spirit. They perceived this and upon the foundation of the qualities just mentioned theyÂ elevated him to the altitude of a hero, and finally even of a martyr. Although the cowardly creature always inwardly said No, he always said Yes with his lips, even upon the scaffold, where he died for the tenets of his party: for beside him stood one of his old associates who so domineered him with look and word that he actually went to his death with the utmost fortitude and has ever since been celebrated as a martyr and exalted character.</div><div class="paragraph"><strong>74</strong></div><div class="paragraph"><strong>General Standard.</strong>â€”One will rarely err if extreme actions be ascribed to vanity, ordinary actions to habit and mean actions to fear.</div><div class="paragraph"><strong>75</strong></div><div class="paragraph"><strong>Misunderstanding of Virtue.</strong>â€”Whoever has obtained his experience of vice in connection with pleasure as in the case of one with a youth of wild oats behind him, comes to the conclusion that virtue must be connected with self denial. Whoever, on the other hand, has been very much plagued by his passions and vices, longs to find in virtue the rest and peace of the soul. That is why it is possible for two virtuous people to misunderstand one another wholly.</div><div class="paragraph"><strong>76</strong></div><div class="paragraph"><strong>The Ascetic.</strong>â€”The ascetic makes out of virtue a slavery.</div><div class="paragraph"><strong>77</strong></div><div class="paragraph"><strong>Honor Transferred from Persons to Things.</strong>â€”Actions prompted by love or by the spirit of self sacrifice for others are universally honored wherever they are manifest. Hence is magnified the value set upon whatever things may be loved or whatever things conduce to self sacrifice: although in themselves they may be worth nothing much. A valiant army is evidence of the value of the thing it fights for.</div><div class="paragraph"><strong>78</strong></div><div class="paragraph"><strong>Ambition a Substitute for Moral Feeling.</strong>â€”Moral feeling should never become extinct in natures that are destitute of ambition. The ambitious can get along without moral feeling just as well as with it.â€”Hence the sons of retired, ambitionless families, generally become by a series of rapid gradations, when they lose moral feeling, the most absolute lunkheads.</div><div class="paragraph"><strong>79</strong></div><div class="paragraph"><strong>Vanity Enriches.</strong>â€”How poor the human mind would be without vanity! As it is, it resemblesÂ a well stacked and ever renewed ware-emporium that attracts buyers of every class: they can find almost everything, have almost everything, provided they bring with them the right kind of moneyâ€”admiration.</div><div class="paragraph"><strong>80</strong></div><div class="paragraph"><strong>Senility and Death.</strong>â€”Apart from the demands made by religion, it may well be asked why it is more honorable in an aged man, who feels the decline of his powers, to await slow extinction than to fix a term to his existence himself? Suicide in such a case is a quite natural and due proceeding that ought to command respect as a triumph of reason: and did in fact command respect during the times of the masters of Greek philosophy and the bravest Roman patriots, who usually died by their own hand. Eagerness, on the other hand, to keep alive from day to day with the anxious counsel of physicians, without capacity to attain any nearer to one&#x27;s ideal of life, is far less worthy of respect.â€”Religions are very rich in refuges from the mandate of suicide: hence they ingratiate themselves with those who cling to life.</div><div class="paragraph"><strong>81</strong></div><div class="paragraph"><strong>Delusions Regarding Victim and Regarding Evil Doer.</strong>â€”When the rich man takes aÂ possession away from the poor man (for example, a prince who deprives a plebeian of his beloved) there arises in the mind of the poor man a delusion: he thinks the rich man must be wholly perverted to take from him the little that he has. But the rich man appreciates the value of a single possession much less because he is accustomed to many possessions, so that he cannot put himself in the place of the poor man and does not act by any means as ill as the latter supposes. Both have a totally false idea of each other. The iniquities of the mighty which bulk most largely in history are not nearly so monstrous as they seem. The hereditary consciousness of being a superior being with superior environment renders one very callous and lulls the conscience to rest. We all feel, when the difference between ourselves and some other being is exceedingly great, that no element of injustice can be involved, and we kill a fly with no qualms of conscience whatever. So, too, it is no indication of wickedness in Xerxes (whom even the Greeks represent as exceptionally noble) that he deprived a father of his son and had him drawn and quartered because the latter had manifested a troublesome, ominous distrust of an entire expedition: the individual was in this case brushed aside as a pestiferous insect. He was too low and mean to justify continued sentiments ofÂ compunction in the ruler of the world. Indeed no cruel man is ever as cruel, in the main, as his victim thinks. The idea of pain is never the same as the sensation. </div><div class="paragraph">The rule is precisely analogous in the case of the unjust judge, and of the journalist who by means of devious rhetorical methods, leads public opinion astray. Cause and effect are in all these instances entwined with totally different series of feeling and thoughts, whereas it is unconsciously assumed that principal and victim feel and think exactly alike, and because of this assumption the guilt of the one is based upon the pain of the other.</div><div class="paragraph"><strong>82</strong></div><div class="paragraph"><strong>The Soul&#x27;s Skin.</strong>â€”As the bones, flesh, entrails and blood vessels are enclosed by a skin that renders the aspect of men endurable, so the impulses and passions of the soul are enclosed by vanity: it is the skin of the soul.</div><div class="paragraph"><strong>83</strong></div><div class="paragraph"><strong>Sleep of Virtue.</strong>â€”If virtue goes to sleep, it will be more vigorous when it awakes.</div><div class="paragraph"><strong>84</strong></div><div class="paragraph"><strong>Subtlety of Shame.</strong>â€”Men are not ashamed of obscene thoughts, but they are ashamed whenÂ they suspect that obscene thoughts are attributed to them.</div><div class="paragraph"><strong>85</strong></div><div class="paragraph"><strong>Naughtiness Is Rare.</strong>â€”Most people are too much absorbed in themselves to be bad.</div><div class="paragraph"><strong>86</strong></div><div class="paragraph"><strong>The Mite in the Balance.</strong>â€”We are praised or blamed, as the one or the other may be expedient, for displaying to advantage our power of discernment.</div><div class="paragraph"><strong>87</strong></div><div class="paragraph"><strong>Luke 18:14 Improved.</strong>â€”He that humbleth himself wisheth to be exalted.</div><div class="paragraph"><strong>88</strong></div><div class="paragraph"><strong>Prevention of Suicide.</strong>â€”There is a justice according to which we may deprive a man of life, but none that permits us to deprive him of death: this is merely cruelty.</div><div class="paragraph"><strong>89</strong></div><div class="paragraph"><strong>Vanity.â€”</strong>We set store by the good opinion of men, first because it is of use to us and nextÂ because we wish to give them pleasure (children their parents, pupils their teacher, and well disposed persons all others generally). Only when the good opinion of men is important to somebody, apart from personal advantage or the desire to give pleasure, do we speak of vanity. In this last case, a man wants to give himself pleasure, but at the expense of his fellow creatures, inasmuch as he inspires them with a false opinion of himself or else inspires &quot;good opinion&quot; in such a way that it is a source of pain to others (by arousing envy). The individual generally seeks, through the opinion of others, to attest and fortify the opinion he has of himself; but the potent influence of authorityâ€”an influence as old as man himselfâ€”leads many, also, to strengthen their own opinion of themselves by means of authority, that is, to borrow from others the expedient of relying more upon the judgment of their fellow men than upon their own.â€”Interest in oneself, the wish to please oneself attains, with the vain man, such proportions that he first misleads others into a false, unduly exalted estimate of himself and then relies upon the authority of others for his self estimate; he thus creates the delusion that he pins his faith to.â€”It must, however, be admitted that the vain man does not desire to please others so much as himself and he will often go so far,Â on this account, as to overlook his own interests: for he often inspires his fellow creatures with malicious envy and renders them ill disposed in order that he may thus increase his own delight in himself.</div><div class="paragraph"><strong>90</strong></div><div class="paragraph"><strong>Limits of the Love of Mankind.</strong>â€”Every man who has declared that some other man is an ass or a scoundrel, gets angry when the other man conclusively shows that the assertion was erroneous.</div><div class="paragraph"><strong>91</strong></div><div class="paragraph"><strong>Weeping Morality.</strong>â€”How much delight morality occasions! Think of the ocean of pleasing tears that has flowed from the narration of noble, great-hearted deeds!â€”This charm of life would disappear if the belief in complete irresponsibility gained the upper hand.</div><div class="paragraph"><strong>92</strong></div><div class="paragraph"><strong>Origin of Justice.</strong>â€”Justice (reasonableness) has its origin among approximate equals in power, as Thucydides (in the dreadful conferences of the Athenian and Melian envoys) hasÂ rightly conceived. Thus, where there exists no demonstrable supremacy and a struggle leads but to mutual, useless damage, the reflection arises that an understanding would best be arrived at and some compromise entered into. The reciprocal nature is hence the first nature of justice. Each party makes the other content inasmuch as each receives what it prizes more highly than the other. Each surrenders to the other what the other wants and receives in return its own desire. Justice is therefore reprisal and exchange upon the basis of an approximate equality of power. Thus revenge pertains originally to the domain of justice as it is a sort of reciprocity. Equally so, gratitude.â€”Justice reverts naturally to the standpoint of self preservation, therefore to the egoism of this consideration: &quot;why should I injure myself to no purpose and perhaps never attain my end?&quot;â€”So much for the origin of justice. Only because men, through mental habits, have forgotten the original motive of so called just and rational acts, and also because for thousands of years children have been brought to admire and imitate such acts, have they gradually assumed the appearance of being unegotistical. Upon this appearance is founded the high estimate of them, which, moreover, like all estimates, is continually developing, for whatever is highly esteemed is striven for, imitated,Â made the object of self sacrifice, while the merit of the pain and emulation thus expended is, by each individual, ascribed to the thing esteemed.â€”How slightly moral would the world appear without forgetfulness! A poet could say that God had posted forgetfulness as a sentinel at the portal of the temple of human merit!</div><div class="paragraph"><strong>93</strong></div><div class="paragraph"><strong>Concerning the Law of the Weaker.</strong>â€”Whenever any party, for instance, a besieged city, yields to a stronger party, under stipulated conditions, the counter stipulation is that there be a reduction to insignificance, a burning and destruction of the city and thus a great damage inflicted upon the stronger party. Thus arises a sort of equalization principle upon the basis of which a law can be established. The enemy has an advantage to gain by its maintenance.â€”To this extent there is also a law between slaves and masters, limited only by the extent to which the slave may be useful to his master. The law goes originally only so far as the one party may appear to the other potent, invincible, stable, and the like. To such an extent, then, the weaker has rights, but very limited ones. Hence the famous dictum that each has as much law on his side as his power extends (or more accurately, as his power is believed to extend).</div><div class="paragraph"><strong>94</strong></div><div class="paragraph"><strong>The Three Phases of Morality Hitherto.</strong>â€”It is the first evidence that the animal has become human when his conduct ceases to be based upon the immediately expedient, but upon the permanently useful; when he has, therefore, grown utilitarian, capable of purpose. Thus is manifested the first rule of reason. A still higher stage is attained when he regulates his conduct upon the basis of honor, by means of which he gains mastery of himself and surrenders his desires to principles; this lifts him far above the phase in which he was actuated only by considerations of personal advantage as he understood it. He respects and wishes to be respected. This means that he comprehends utility as a thing dependent upon what his opinion of others is and their opinion of him. Finally he regulates his conduct (the highest phase of morality hitherto attained) by his own standard of men and things. He himself decides, for himself and for others, what is honorable and what is useful. He has become a law giver to opinion, upon the basis of his ever higher developing conception of the utilitarian and the honorable. Knowledge makes him capable of placing the highest utility, (that is, the universal, enduring utility) before merely personal utility,â€”of placing ennoblingÂ recognition of the enduring and universal before the merely temporary: he lives and acts as a collective individuality.</div><div class="paragraph"><strong>95</strong></div><div class="paragraph"><strong>Ethic of the Developed Individual.</strong>â€”Hitherto the altruistic has been looked upon as the distinctive characteristic of moral conduct, and it is manifest that it was the consideration of universal utility that prompted praise and recognition of altruistic conduct. Must not a radical departure from this point of view be imminent, now that it is being ever more clearly perceived that in the most personal considerations the most general welfare is attained: so that conduct inspired by the most personal considerations of advantage is just the sort which has its origin in the present conception of morality (as a universal utilitarianism)? To contemplate oneself as a complete personality and bear the welfare of that personality in mind in all that one doesâ€”this is productive of better results than any sympathetic susceptibility and conduct in behalf of others. Indeed we all suffer from such disparagement of our own personalities, which are at present made to deteriorate from neglect. Capacity is, in fact, divorced from our personality in most cases, and sacrificed to the state, toÂ science, to the needy, as if it were the bad which deserved to be made a sacrifice. Now, we are willing to labor for our fellowmen but only to the extent that we find our own highest advantage in so doing, no more, no less. The whole matter depends upon what may be understood as one&#x27;s advantage: the crude, undeveloped, rough individualities will be the very ones to estimate it most inadequately.</div><div class="paragraph"><strong>96</strong></div><div class="paragraph"><strong>Usage and Ethic.</strong>â€”To be moral, virtuous, praiseworthy means to yield obedience to ancient law and hereditary usage. Whether this obedience be rendered readily or with difficulty is long immaterial. Enough that it be rendered. &quot;Good&quot; finally comes to mean him who acts in the traditional manner, as a result of heredity or natural disposition, that is to say does what is customary with scarcely an effort, whatever that may be (for example revenges injuries when revenge, as with the ancient Greeks, was part of good morals). He is called good because he is good &quot;to some purpose,&quot; and as benevolence, sympathy, considerateness, moderation and the like come, in the general course of conduct, to be finally recognized as &quot;good to some purpose&quot; (as utilitarian) the benevolent man, the helpfulÂ man, is duly styled &quot;good&quot;. (At first other and more important kinds of utilitarian qualities stand in the foreground.) Bad is &quot;not habitual&quot; (unusual), to do things not in accordance with usage, to oppose the traditional, however rational or the reverse the traditional may be. To do injury to one&#x27;s social group or community (and to one&#x27;s neighbor as thus understood) is looked upon, through all the variations of moral laws, in different ages, as the peculiarly &quot;immoral&quot; act, so that to-day we associate the word &quot;bad&quot; with deliberate injury to one&#x27;s neighbor or community. &quot;Egoistic&quot; and &quot;non-egoistic&quot; do not constitute the fundamental opposites that have brought mankind to make a distinction between moral and immoral, good and bad; but adherence to traditional custom, and emancipation from it. How the traditional had its origin is quite immaterial; in any event it had no reference to good and bad or any categorical imperative but to the all important end of maintaining and sustaining the community, the race, the confederation, the nation. Every superstitious custom that originated in a misinterpreted event or casualty entailed some tradition, to adhere to which is moral. To break loose from it is dangerous, more prejudicial to the community than to the individual (because divinity visits the consequences of impiety and sacrilege upon the community ratherÂ than upon the individual). Now every tradition grows ever more venerableâ€”the more remote is its origin, the more confused that origin is. The reverence due to it increases from generation to generation. The tradition finally becomes holy and inspires awe. Thus it is that the precept of piety is a far loftier morality than that inculcated by altruistic conduct.</div><div class="paragraph"><strong>97</strong></div><div class="paragraph"><strong>Delight in the Moral.</strong>â€”A potent species of joy (and thereby the source of morality) is custom. The customary is done more easily, better, therefore preferably. A pleasure is felt in it and experience thus shows that since this practice has held its own it must be good. A manner or moral that lives and lets live is thus demonstrated advantageous, necessary, in contradistinction to all new and not yet adopted practices. The custom is therefore the blending of the agreeable and the useful. Moreover it does not require deliberation. As soon as man can exercise compulsion, he exercises it to enforce and establish his customs, for they are to him attested lifewisdom. So, too, a community of individuals constrains each one of their number to adopt the same moral or custom. The error herein is this: Because a certain customÂ has been agreeable to the feelings or at least because it proves a means of maintenance, this custom must be imperative, for it is regarded as the only thing that can possibly be consistent with well being. </div><div class="paragraph">The well being of life seems to spring from it alone. This conception of the customary as a condition of existence is carried into the slightest detail of morality. Inasmuch as insight into true causation is quite restricted in all inferior peoples, a superstitious anxiety is felt that everything be done in due routine. Even when a custom is exceedingly burdensome it is preserved because of its supposed vital utility. It is not known that the same degree of satisfaction can be experienced through some other custom and even higher degrees of satisfaction, too. But it is fully appreciated that all customs do become more agreeable with the lapse of time, no matter how difficult they may have been found in the beginning, and that even the severest way of life may be rendered a matter of habit and therefore a pleasure.</div><div class="paragraph"><strong>98</strong></div><div class="paragraph"><strong>Pleasure and Social Instinct.</strong>â€”Through his relations with other men, man derives a new species of delight in those pleasurable emotions which his own personality affords him; wherebyÂ the domain of pleasurable emotions is made infinitely more comprehensive. No doubt he has inherited many of these feelings from the brutes, which palpably feel delight when they sport with one another, as mothers with their young. So, too, the sexual relations must be taken into account: they make every young woman interesting to every young man from the standpoint of pleasure, and conversely. The feeling of pleasure originating in human relationships makes men in general better. The delight in common, the pleasures enjoyed together heighten one another. The individual feels a sense of security. He becomes better natured. Distrust and malice dissolve. For the man feels the sense of benefit and observes the same feeling in others. Mutual manifestations of pleasure inspire mutual sympathy, the sentiment of homogeneity. The same effect is felt also at mutual sufferings, in a common danger, in stormy weather. Upon such a foundation are built the earliest alliances: the object of which is the mutual protection and safety from threatening misfortunes, and the welfare of each individual. And thus the social instinct develops from pleasure.</div><div class="paragraph"><strong>99</strong></div><div class="paragraph"><strong>The Guiltless Nature of So-Called Bad Acts.</strong>â€”All &quot;bad&quot; acts are inspired by the impulseÂ to self preservation or, more accurately, by the desire for pleasure and for the avoidance of pain in the individual. Thus are they occasioned, but they are not, therefore, bad. &quot;Pain self prepared&quot; does not exist, except in the brains of the philosophers, any more than &quot;pleasure self prepared&quot; (sympathy in the Schopenhauer sense). In the condition anterior to the state we kill the creature, be it man or ape, that attempts to pluck the fruit of a tree before we pluck it ourselves should we happen to be hungry at the time and making for that tree: as we would do to-day, so far as the brute is concerned, if we were wandering in savage regions.â€”The bad acts which most disturb us at present do so because of the erroneous supposition that the one who is guilty of them towards us has a free will in the matter and that it was within his discretion not to have done these evil things. This belief in discretionary power inspires hate, thirst for revenge, malice, the entire perversion of the mental processes, whereas we would feel in no way incensed against the brute, as we hold it irresponsible. </div><div class="paragraph">To inflict pain not from the instinct of self preservation but in requitalâ€”this is the consequence of false judgment and is equally a guiltless course of conduct. The individual can, in that condition which is anterior to the state, act with fierceness and violence for the intimidationÂ of another creature, in order to render his own power more secure as a result of such acts of intimidation. Thus acts the powerful, the superior, the original state founder, who subjugates the weaker. He has the right to do so, as the state nowadays assumes the same right, or, to be more accurate, there is no right that can conflict with this. A foundation for all morality can first be laid only when a stronger individuality or a collective individuality, for example society, the state, subjects the single personalities, hence builds upon their unification and establishes a bond of union. Morality results from compulsion, it is indeed itself one long compulsion to which obedience is rendered in order that pain may be avoided. At first it is but custom, later free obedience and finally almost instinct. At last it is (like everything habitual and natural) associated with pleasureâ€”and is then called virtue.</div><div class="paragraph"><strong>100</strong></div><div class="paragraph"><strong>Shame.</strong>â€”Shame exists wherever a &quot;mystery&quot; exists: but this is a religious notion which in the earlier period of human civilization had great vogue. Everywhere there were circumscribed spots to which access was denied on account of some divine law, except in special circumstances.At first these spots were quite extensive, inasmuch as stipulated areas could not be trod by the uninitiated, who, when near them, felt tremors and anxieties. This sentiment was frequently transferred to other relationships, for example to sexual relations, which, as the privilege and gateway of mature age, must be withdrawn from the contemplation of youth for its own advantage: relations which many divinities were busy in preserving and sanctifying, images of which divinities were duly placed in marital chambers as guardians. (In Turkish such an apartment is termed a harem or holy thing, the same word also designating the vestibule of a mosque). So, too, Kingship is regarded as a centre from which power and brilliance stream forth, as a mystery to the subjects, impregnated with secrecy and shame, sentiments still quite operative among peoples who in other respects are without any shame at all. So, too, is the whole world of inward states, the so-called &quot;soul,&quot; even now, for all non-philosophical persons, a &quot;mystery,&quot; and during countless ages it was looked upon as a something of divine origin, in direct communion with deity. It is, therefore, an adytum and occasions shame.</div><div class="paragraph"><strong>101</strong></div><div class="paragraph"><strong>Judge Not.</strong>â€”Care must be taken, in the contemplation of earlier ages, that there be no fallingÂ into unjust scornfulness. The injustice in slavery, the cruelty in the subjugation of persons and peoples must not be estimated by our standard. For in that period the instinct of justice was not so highly developed. Who dare reproach the Genoese Calvin for burning the physician Servetus at the stake? It was a proceeding growing out of his convictions. And the Inquisition, too, had its justification. The only thing is that the prevailing views were false and led to those proceedings which seem so cruel to us, simply because such views have become foreign to us. Besides, what is the burning alive of one individual compared with eternal hell pains for everybody else? And yet this idea then had hold of all the world without in the least vitiating, with its frightfulness, the other idea of a god. Even we nowadays are hard and merciless to political revolutionists, but that is because we are in the habit of believing the state a necessity, and hence the cruelty of the proceeding is not so much understood as in the other cases where the points of view are repudiated. The cruelty to animals shown by children and Italians is due to the same misunderstanding. The animal, owing to the exigencies of the church catechism, is placed too far below the level of mankind.â€”Much, too, that is frightful and inhuman in history, and which is almost incredible, is renderedÂ less atrocious by the reflection that the one who commands and the one who executes are different persons. The former does not witness the performance and hence it makes no strong impression on him. The latter obeys a superior and hence feels no responsibility. Most princes and military chieftains appear, through lack of true perception, cruel and hard without really being so.â€”Egoism is not bad because the idea of the &quot;neighbor&quot;â€”the word is of Christian origin and does not correspond to truthâ€”is very weak in us, and we feel ourselves, in regard to him, as free from responsibility as if plants and stones were involved. That another is in suffering must be learned and it can never be wholly learned.</div><div class="paragraph"><strong>102</strong></div><div class="paragraph"><strong>&quot;Man Always Does Right.&quot;</strong>â€”We do not blame nature when she sends a thunder storm and makes us wet: why then do we term the man who inflicts injury immoral? Because in the latter case we assume a voluntary, ruling, free will, and in the former necessity. But this distinction is a delusion. Moreover, even the intentional infliction of injury is not, in all circumstances termed immoral. Thus, we kill a fly intentionallyÂ without thinking very much about it, simply because its buzzing about is disagreeable; and we punish a criminal and inflict pain upon him in order to protect ourselves and society. In the first case it is the individual who, for the sake of preserving himself or in order to spare himself pain, does injury with design: in the second case, it is the state. All ethic deems intentional infliction of injury justified by necessity; that is when it is a matter of self preservation. But these two points of view are sufficient to explain all bad acts done by man to men. It is desired to obtain pleasure or avoid pain. In any sense, it is a question, always, of self preservation. Socrates and Plato are right: whatever man does he always does right: that is, does what seems to him good (advantageous) according to the degree of advancement his intellect has attained, which is always the measure of his rational capacity.</div><div class="paragraph"><strong>103</strong></div><div class="paragraph"><strong>The Inoffensive in Badness.</strong>â€”Badness has not for its object the infliction of pain upon others but simply our own satisfaction as, for instance, in the case of thirst for vengeance or of nerve excitation. Every act of teasing shows what pleasure is caused by the display of ourÂ power over others and what feelings of delight are experienced in the sense of domination. Is there, then, anything immoral in feeling pleasure in the pain of others? Is malicious joy devilish, as Schopenhauer says? In the realm of nature we feel joy in breaking boughs, shattering rocks, fighting with wild beasts, simply to attest our strength thereby. Should not the knowledge that another suffers on our account here, in this case, make the same kind of act, (which, by the way, arouses no qualms of conscience in us) immoral also? But if we had not this knowledge there would be no pleasure in one&#x27;s own superiority or power, for this pleasure is experienced only in the suffering of another, as in the case of teasing. All pleasure is, in itself, neither good nor bad. </div><div class="paragraph">Whence comes the conviction that one should not cause pain in others in order to feel pleasure oneself? Simply from the standpoint of utility, that is, in consideration of the consequences, of ultimate pain, since the injured party or state will demand satisfaction and revenge. This consideration alone can have led to the determination to renounce such pleasure.â€”Sympathy has the satisfaction of others in view no more than, as already stated, badness has the pain of others in view. For there are at least two (perhaps many more) elementary ingredients in personal gratification which enter largelyÂ into our self satisfaction: one of them being the pleasure of the emotion, of which species is sympathy with tragedy, and another, when the impulse is to action, being the pleasure of exercising one&#x27;s power. Should a sufferer be very dear to us, we divest ourselves of pain by the performance of acts of sympathy.â€”With the exception of some few philosophers, men have placed sympathy very low in the rank of moral feelings: and rightly.</div><div class="paragraph"><strong>104</strong></div><div class="paragraph"><strong>Self Defence.</strong>â€”If self defence is in general held a valid justification, then nearly every manifestation of so called immoral egoism must be justified, too. Pain is inflicted, robbery or killing done in order to maintain life or to protect oneself and ward off harm. A man lies when cunning and delusion are valid means of self preservation. To injure intentionally when our safety and our existence are involved, or the continuance of our well being, is conceded to be moral. The state itself injures from this motive when it hangs criminals. In unintentional injury the immoral, of course, can not be present, as accident alone is involved. But is there any sort of intentional injury in which our existence and the maintenance of our well being be not involved?Â Is there such a thing as injuring from absolute badness, for example, in the case of cruelty? If a man does not know what pain an act occasions, that act is not one of wickedness. Thus the child is not bad to the animal, not evil. It disturbs and rends it as if it were one of its playthings. Does a man ever fully know how much pain an act may cause another? As far as our nervous system extends, we shield ourselves from pain. If it extended further, that is, to our fellow men, we would never cause anyone else any pain (except in such cases as we cause it to ourselves, when we cut ourselves, surgically, to heal our ills, or strive and trouble ourselves to gain health). We conclude from analogy that something pains somebody and can in consequence, through recollection and the power of imagination, feel pain also. But what a difference there always is between the tooth ache and the pain (sympathy) that the spectacle of tooth ache occasions! </div><div class="paragraph">Therefore when injury is inflicted from so called badness the degree of pain thereby experienced is always unknown to us: in so far, however, as pleasure is felt in the act (a sense of one&#x27;s own power, of one&#x27;s own excitation) the act is committed to maintain the well being of the individual and hence comes under the purview of self defence and lying for self preservation. Without pleasure, there is noÂ life; the struggle for pleasure is the struggle for life. Whether the individual shall carry on this struggle in such a way that he be called good or in such a way that he be called bad is something that the standard and the capacity of his own intellect must determine for him.</div><div class="paragraph"><strong>105</strong></div><div class="paragraph"><strong>Justice that Rewards.</strong>â€”Whoever has fully understood the doctrine of absolute irresponsibility can no longer include the so called rewarding and punishing justice in the idea of justice, if the latter be taken to mean that to each be given his due. For he who is punished does not deserve the punishment. He is used simply as a means to intimidate others from certain acts. Equally, he who is rewarded does not merit the reward. He could not act any differently than he did act. Hence the reward has only the significance of an encouragement to him and others as a motive for subsequent acts. The praise is called out only to him who is running in the race and not to him who has arrived at the goal. Something that comes to someone as his own is neither a punishment nor a reward. It is given to him from utiliarian considerations, without his having any claim to it in justice. Hence one must say &quot;the wise man praises notÂ because a good act has been done&quot; precisely as was once said: &quot;the wise man punishes not because a bad act has been done but in order that a bad act may not be done.&quot; If punishment and reward ceased, there would cease with them the most powerful incentives to certain acts and away from other acts. The purposes of men demand their continuance [of punishment and reward] and inasmuch as punishment and reward, blame and praise operate most potently upon vanity, these same purposes of men imperatively require the continuance of vanity.</div><div class="paragraph"><strong>106</strong></div><div class="paragraph"><strong>The Water Fall.</strong>â€”At the sight of a water fall we may opine that in the countless curves, spirations and dashes of the waves we behold freedom of the will and of the impulses. But everything is compulsory, everything can be mathematically calculated. Thus it is, too, with human acts. We would be able to calculate in advance every single action if we were all knowing, as well as every advance in knowledge, every delusion, every bad deed. The acting individual himself is held fast in the illusion of volition. If, on a sudden, the entire movement of the world stopped short, and an all knowing and reasoning intelligence were there to take advantageÂ of this pause, he could foretell the future of every being to the remotest ages and indicate the path that would be taken in the world&#x27;s further course. The deception of the acting individual as regards himself, the assumption of the freedom of the will, is a part of this computable mechanism.</div><div class="paragraph"><strong>107</strong></div><div class="paragraph"><strong>Non-Responsibility and Non-Guilt.</strong>â€”The absolute irresponsibility of man for his acts and his nature is the bitterest drop in the cup of him who has knowledge, if he be accustomed to behold in responsibility and duty the patent of nobility of his human nature. All his estimates, preferences, dislikes are thus made worthless and false. His deepest sentiment, with which he honored the sufferer, the hero, sprang from an error. He may no longer praise, no longer blame, for it is irrational to blame and praise nature and necessity. Just as he cherishes the beautiful work of art, but does not praise it (as it is incapable of doing anything for itself), just as he stands in the presence of plants, he must stand in the presence of human conduct, his own included. He may admire strength, beauty, capacity, therein, but he can discern no merit. The chemical process and the conflict of the elements,Â the ordeal of the invalid who strives for convalescence, are no more merits than the soul-struggles and extremities in which one is torn this way and that by contending motives until one finally decides in favor of the strongestâ€”as the phrase has it, although, in fact, it is the strongest motive that decides for us. All these motives, however, whatever fine names we may give them, have grown from the same roots in which we believe the baneful poisons lurk. Between good and bad actions there is no difference in kind but, at most, in degree. Good acts are sublimated evil. Bad acts are degraded, imbruted good. The very longing of the individual for self gratification (together with the fear of being deprived of it) obtains satisfaction in all circumstances, let the individual act as he may, that is, as he must: be it in deeds of vanity, revenge, pleasure, utility, badness, cunning, be it in deeds of self sacrifice, sympathy or knowledge. The degrees of rational capacity determine the direction in which this longing impels: every society, every individual has constantly present a comparative classification of benefits in accordance with which conduct is determined and others are judged. But this standard perpetually changes. Many acts are called bad that are only stupid, because the degree of intelligence that decided for them was low. Indeed,Â in a certain sense, all acts now are stupid, for the highest degree of human intelligence that has yet been attained will in time most certainly be surpassed and then, in retrospection, all our present conduct and opinion will appear as narrow and petty as we now deem the conduct and opinion of savage peoples and ages.â€”To perceive all these things may occasion profound pain but there is, nevertheless, a consolation. Such pains are birth pains. The butterfly insists upon breaking through the cocoon, he presses through it, tears it to pieces, only to be blinded and confused by the strange light, by the realm of liberty. By such men as are capable of this sadnessâ€”how few there are!â€”will the first attempt be made to see if humanity may convert itself from a thing of morality to a thing of wisdom. The sun of a new gospel sheds its first ray upon the loftiest height in the souls of those few: but the clouds are massed there, too, thicker than ever, and not far apart are the brightest sunlight and the deepest gloom. </div><div class="paragraph">Everything is necessityâ€”so says the new knowledge: and this knowledge is itself necessity. All is guiltlessness, and knowledge is the way to insight into this guiltlessness. If pleasure, egoism, vanity be necessary to attest the moral phenomena and their richest blooms, the instinct for truth and accuracy of knowledge; if delusionÂ and confusion of the imagination were the only means whereby mankind could gradually lift itself up to this degree of self enlightenment and self emancipationâ€”who would venture to disparage the means? Who would have the right to feel sad if made aware of the goal to which those paths lead? Everything in the domain of ethic is evolved, changeable, tottering; all things flow, it is trueâ€”but all things are also in the stream: to their goal. Though within us the hereditary habit of erroneous judgment, love, hate, may be ever dominant, yet under the influence of awaking knowledge it will ever become weaker: a new habit, that of understanding, not-loving, not-hating, looking from above, grows up within us gradually and in the same soil, and may, perhaps, in thousands of years be powerful enough to endow mankind with capacity to develop the wise, guiltless man (conscious of guiltlessness) as unfailingly as it now developes the unwise, irrational, guilt-conscious manâ€”that is to say, the necessary higher step, not the opposite of it.</div><div class="Divider"><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i></div><div class="paragraph"><em>About HackerNoon Book Series: We bring you the most important technical, scientific, and insightful public domain books.</em></div><div class="paragraph"><em>This book is part of the public domain.Â Nietzsche, Friedrich.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As if the <strong><a href="https://hackernoon.com/polls">console wars</a></strong> weren't bad enough, now PC gamers have to get into the same dilemma: go for team red or team blue. Yes, ICYMI, <strong><a href="https://hackernoon.com/company/amd">AMD</a></strong> finally released the Ryzen 7000 series chips last week in a bid to win back performance nerds over to its side, prompting at least one hardcore <strong><a href="https://hackernoon.com/company/intel">Intel</a></strong> fanboy editor here at HackerNoon to switch sides (you know who you are!).</p>
<p>\
Performance-wise, reviews of AMD's Ryzen 7000 series have been <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vLq2PjmIx0">largely positive</a></strong> but as <em>The Verge</em> points out, this is <strong><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23372439/amd-ryzen-9-7900x-cpu-processor-review-benchmark-test">only the beginning</a></strong>. While Intel's 12th gen processors are understood to have <strong><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/549847/intel-alder-lake-vs-ryzen-5000-5-things-to-know.html">performed better</a></strong> than AMD's Ryzen 5000 series, AMD's spanking new 7000 series chips are beating the competition (not counting gaming performance, since that's been.. meh). Still, Intel is expected to <strong><a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-13th-gen-raptor-lake-release-date-specifications-pricing-benchmarks-all-we-know-specs">announce</a></strong> more details about its 13th gen Raptor Lake processors soon, and if they're truly <strong><a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-teases-8-ghz-raptor-lake-world-record">as good</a></strong> as the company says they are, the Intel vs. AMD rivalry will usher into a new age.</p>
<p>\
With so much happening, Intel ranked on the #72 spot. AMD is yet to chart the rankings, but we'll keep you posted when it does.</p>
<p>\
That said, <strong><a href="https://hackernoon.com/company/facebook">Facebook</a></strong> continues to remain at the top of the tech company rankings for.. we don't even remember how many weeks anymore. Facebook co-founder and future metaverse god (lol?) Mark Zuckerberg told employees last week that Facebook-parent Meta Platforms will put the brakes on hiring and <strong><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-29/meta-announces-hiring-freeze-warns-employees-of-restructuring#xj4y7vzkg">let go</a></strong> of some people, joining the likes of <strong><a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/companies-cut-jobs-freeze-hiring-prepare-economic-slowdown-2022-07-29/">other tech giants</a></strong> who are also taking similar action in light of prevailing macroeconomic conditions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>\
Notably, this would be the first time Meta would be reducing its headcount. Surely, Zuck feels a bit of remorse for the difficult decision ahead? Right? Right!?&nbsp;</p>
<p>\
Absolutely not. Just days after the layoffs story broke, Zuckerberg was spotted in Las Vegas with his entourage to <strong><a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/mma-worst-kept-secret-confirmed-011547360.html">attend</a></strong> UFC Fight Night 211 card at the UFC Apex :boxing_glove:. Clearly not willing to rub shoulders with the rest of the world, Zuckerberg is said to have received a <strong><a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/2022/10/1/23382782/stay-home-bro-fighters-react-to-mark-zuckerbergs-private-show-at-ufc-vegas-61">private viewing</a></strong> of the matches with no media allowed (his wife <strong><a href="https://www.twitter.com/GilbertDurinho/status/1576372598619140098?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1576372598619140098%7Ctwgr%5E109bb3be86c4850c0b8e658228414056eaff8c87%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mmafighting.com%2F2022%2F10%2F1%2F23382782%2Fstay-home-bro-fighters-react-to-mark-zuckerbergs-private-show-at-ufc-vegas-61">wasn't having any of it</a></strong>, though).</p>
<p>\
Just goes to show how unrelatable Zuckerberg is with the average person on the planet.&nbsp;</p>

<strong>Google Swipes Left on Stadia</strong> :video_game:</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://hackernoon.com/company/google">Google</a></strong> <strong><a href="https://blog.google/products/stadia/message-on-stadia-streaming-strategy/">pulled the switch</a></strong> on Stadia this past week after noting that the cloud gaming service hadn't gained the traction it was hoping it would. By now, the pattern is pretty clear: things just aren't looking too good economically speaking, so companies are doing what they can to offload businesses and services that just aren't core to their bottomline.</p>
<p>\
According to <em>Kotaku</em>, game devs and Stadia employees alike were <strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/stadia-google-bungie-destiny-2-cyberpunk-2077-red-dead-1849601243">blindsided</a></strong> by the <strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/stadia-google-refund-cloud-streaming-assassins-creed-1849597014">announcement</a></strong>. However, a quick glance of the <strong><a href="https://killedbygoogle.com/">Google Graveyard</a></strong> shows that the company is notorious for discontinuing services either because of obsolescence, integration into other Google products, or lack of interest. As <em>Kotaku</em> notes: "Googleâ€™s track record, and Stadiaâ€™s own past, call into question whether it was ever properly committed to the ambitious endeavor."</p>
<p>\
Oh well. Google was trending #5 this week.</p>

<strong>Upwork and the Tale of the $1</strong> :heavy<em>dollar</em>sign:</p>
<p>Popular freelance website <strong><a href="https://hackernoon.com/company/upwork">Upwork</a></strong> attracted the ire of one HackerNoon contributor who <strong><a href="https://hackernoon.com/upwork-in-real-danger-of-losing-millions-over-one-dollar-conversion-fee">ran an expose</a></strong> this past week on the company's $1 'conversion fee.' In essence, the company silently updated its terms of service, requiring users to pay a token $1 fee if a freelancer wants to take their relationship with an employer outside of the Upwork platform.</p>
<p>\
A writer who goes by <strong><a href="https://hackernoon.com/u/nebojsa.todorovic">Ghost of HackerNoon</a></strong> posits that Upwork is doing this to find out exactly <em>who</em> is leaving the company's platform so they can prevent other users from doing so. Is that what it means to kill <strong><a href="https://www.thedrum.com/news/2022/09/29/ad-the-day-old-ways-working-are-dead-upwork-s-zombie-musical">the old ways of working</a></strong>?

<strong>Staying in Florida? Just Forget the Refunds</strong> :partly_sunny:</p>
<p>Guests displaced in Florida in wake of Hurricane Ian were in for a rude awakening last week, relying on the <strong><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-29/airbnb-guests-must-rely-on-hosts-for-hurricane-ian-refunds#xj4y7vzkg">generosity</a></strong> of their hosts for refunds if they had booked lodgings using <strong><a href="https://hackernoon.com/company/airbnb">AirBnB</a></strong>.</p>

AirBnB, which saw a whopping 7,100% increase in trending interest to land on the #3 spot, refused refunds on short-term rentals because its cancellation policy specifically excludes Floridaâ€™s storm season. Yikes!&nbsp;</p>

You can jump to any chapter in this book here: </em><a href="https://app.hackernoon.com/drafts/JT47IoZOuOtq0gQsIQMH"><em>[LINK TO TABLE OF LINK]</em></a><em>. Chapter XXIX: Malthus&#x27;s opinions on rent</em>
</div><h2>CHAPTER XXIX. MR. MALTHUS&#x27;S OPINIONS ON RENT.</h2><div class="paragraph">AlthoughÂ the nature of rent has in the former pages of this work been treated on at some length; yet I consider myself bound to notice some opinions on the subject, which appear to me erroneous, and which are the more important, as they are found in the writings of one to whom, of all men of the present day, some branches of economical science are the most indebted. Of Mr. Malthus&#x27;s Essay on Population, I am happy in the opportunity here afforded me of expressing my admiration. The assaults of the opponents of this great work have only served to prove its strength; and I am persuaded that its just reputation will spread with the cultivation of that science of which it is so eminent an ornament. Mr. Malthus tooâ€”has<a>550</a>Â satisfactorily explained the principles of rent, and shewed that it rises or falls in proportion to the relative advantages, either of fertility or situation, of the different lands in cultivation, and has thereby thrown much light on many difficult points connected with the subject of rent, which were before either unknown, or very imperfectly understood; yet he appears to me to have fallen into some errors, which his authority makes it the more necessary, whilst his characteristic candour renders it less unpleasing to notice. One of these errors lies in supposing rent to be a clear gain and a new creation of riches.</div><div class="paragraph">I do not assent to all the opinions of Mr. Buchanan concerning rent; but with those expressed in the following passage, quoted from his work by Mr. Malthus, I fully agree; and therefore I must dissent from Mr. Malthus&#x27;s comment on them.</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;In this view it (rent) can form no general addition to the stock of the community, as the neat surplus in question is nothing more than a revenue transferred from one class to<a>551</a>Â another; and from the mere circumstance of its thus changing hands, it is clear that no fund can arise, out of which to pay taxes. The revenue which pays for the produce of the land, exists already in the hands of those who purchase that produce; and, if the price of subsistence were lower, it would still remain in their hands, where it would be just as available for taxation as when, by a higher price, it is transferred to the landed proprietor.&quot;</div><div class="paragraph">After various observations on the difference between raw produce and manufactured commodities, Mr. Malthus asks, &quot;Is it possible then, with M. de Sismondi, to regard rent as the sole produce of labour, which has a value purely nominal, and the mere result of that augmentation of price which a seller obtains in consequence of a peculiar privilege; or, with Mr. Buchanan, to consider it as no addition to the national wealth, but merely transfer of value, advantageous only to the landlords, and proportionablyÂ injuriousÂ to the consumers?&quot;<a></a><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/33310/33310-h/33310-h.htm#Footnote_50">50</a></div><div class="paragraph"><a>552</a>I have already expressed my opinion on this subject in treating of rent, and have now only further to add, that rent is a creation of value, as I understand that word, but not a creation of wealth. If the price of corn, from the difficulty of producing any portion of it, should rise from 4l.Â to 5l.Â per quarter, a million of quarters will be of the value of 5,000,000l.Â instead of 4,000,000l., and as this corn will exchange not only for more money but for more of every other commodity, the possessors will have a greater amount of value; and as no one else will in consequence have a less, the society altogether will be possessed of greater value, and in that sense rent is a creation of value. But this value is so far nominal that it adds nothing to the wealth, that is to say, to the necessaries, conveniences, and enjoyments of the society. We should have precisely the same quantity, and no more of commodities, and the same million quarters of corn as before; but the effect of its being rated at 5l.Â per quarter, instead of 4l., would be to transfer a portion of the value of the corn and commodities from their former possessors to the landlords. Rent then is a creation of value, but not a crea<a>553</a>tion of wealth; it adds nothing to the resources of a country, it does not enable it to maintain fleets and armies; for the country would have a greater disposable fund if its land were of a better quality, and it could employ the same capital without generating a rent.</div><div class="paragraph">In another part of Mr. Malthus&#x27;s &quot;inquiry&quot; he observes, &quot;that the immediate cause of rent is obviously the excess of price above the cost of production at which raw produce sells in the market,&quot; and in another place he says, &quot;that the causes of the high price of raw produce may be stated to be three:â€”</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;First, and mainly, that quality of the earth, by which it can be made to yield a greater portion of the necessaries of life than is required for the maintenance of the persons employed on the land.</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;2dly. That quality peculiar to the necessaries of life of being able to create their own demand, or to raise up a number of demanders in proportion to the quantity of necessaries produced.</div><div class="paragraph"><a>554</a>&quot;And 3dly. The comparative scarcity of the most fertile land.&quot; In speaking of the high price of corn, Mr. Malthus evidently does not mean the price per quarter or per bushel, but rather the excess of price for which the whole produce will sell, above the cost of its production, including always in the term &quot;cost of production,&quot; profits as well as wages. One hundred and fifty quarters of corn at 3l.Â 10s.Â per quarter, would yield a larger rent to the landlord than 100 quarters at 4l., provided the cost of production were in both cases the same.</div><div class="paragraph">High price, if the expression be used in this sense, cannot then be called aÂ causeÂ of rent; it cannot be said &quot;that the immediate cause of rent is obviously the excess of price above the cost of production, at which raw produce sells in the market,&quot; for that excess is itself rent. Rent, Mr. Malthus has defined to be &quot;that portion of the value of the whole produce which remains to the owner of the land, after all the outgoings belonging to its cultivation, of whatever kind, have been paid, including the profits of the capital employed, estimated according to the usual and ordinary<a>555</a>Â rate of the profits of agricultural stock at the time being.&quot; Now whatever sum this excess may sell for, is money rent; it is what Mr. Malthus means by &quot;the excess of price above the cost of production at which raw produce sells in the markets;&quot; and therefore in an inquiry into the causes which may elevate the price of raw produce, compared with the cost of production, we are inquiring into the causes which may elevate rent.</div><div class="paragraph">In reference to the first cause of the rise of rent, Mr. Malthus has the following observations: &quot;We still want to know why the consumption and supply are such as to make the price so greatly exceed the cost of production, and the main cause is evidently theÂ fertilityÂ of the earth in producing the necessaries of life. Diminish this plenty, diminish the fertility of the soil, and the excess will diminish; diminish it still further, and it will disappear.&quot; True, the excess of necessaries will diminish and disappear, but that is not the question. The question is, whether the excess of their price above the cost of their production will diminish and disappear, for it is on this, that money rent depends. Is Mr.<a>556</a>Â Malthus warranted in his inference, that because the excess of quantity will diminish and disappear, therefore &quot;the cause of theÂ high priceÂ of the necessaries of life above the cost of production is to be found in their abundance, rather than in their scarcity; and is not only essentially different from the high price occasioned by artificial monopolies, but from the high price of those peculiar products of the earth, not connected with food, which may be called natural and necessary monopolies?&quot;</div><div class="paragraph">Are there no circumstances under which the fertility of the land, and the plenty of its produce may be diminished, without occasioning a diminished excess of its price above the cost of production, that is to say, a diminished rent? If there are, Mr. Malthus&#x27;s proposition is much too universal; for he appears to me to state it as a general principle, true under all circumstances, that rent will rise with the increased fertility of the land, and will fall with its diminished fertility.</div><div class="paragraph">Mr. Malthus would undoubtedly be right, if, in proportion as the land yielded abundantly,<a>557</a>Â a greater share of the whole produce were paid to the landlord; but the contrary is the fact: when no other but the most fertile land is in cultivation, the landlord has the smallest share of the whole produce, as well as the smallest value, and it is only when inferior lands are required to feed an augmenting population, that both the landlord&#x27;s share of the whole produce, and the value he receives, progressively increase.</div><div class="paragraph">Suppose that the demand is for a million of quarters of corn, and that they are the produce of the land actually in cultivation. Now, suppose the fertility of all the land to be so diminished, that the very same lands will yield only 900,000 quarters. The demand being for a million of quarters, the price of corn would rise, and recourse must necessarily be had to land of an inferior quality sooner than if the superior land had continued to produce a million of quarters. But it is this necessity of taking inferior land into cultivation which is the cause of the rise of rent. Rent, it must be remembered, is not in proportion to the absolute fertility of the land in cultivation, but in proportion to its<a>558</a>Â relative fertility. Whatever cause may drive capital to inferior land, must elevate rent; the cause of rent being, as stated by Mr. Malthus in his third proposition, &quot;the comparative scarcity of the most fertile land.&quot; The price of corn will naturally rise with the difficulty of producing the last portions of it; but as the cost of production will not increase, as wages and profits taken together will continue always of the same value,<a></a><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/33310/33310-h/33310-h.htm#Footnote_51">51</a>Â it is evident that the excess of price above the cost of production, or, in other words, rent, must rise with the diminished fertility of the land, unless it is counteracted by a great reduction of capital, population, and demand. It does not appear then that Mr. Malthus&#x27;s proposition is correct: rent does not immediately and necessarily rise or fall with the increased or diminished fertility of the land; but its increased fertility renders it capable of paying at some future time an augmented rent. Land possessed of veryÂ <a>559</a>little fertility can never bear any rent; land of moderate fertility may be made, as population increases, to bear a moderate rent; and land of great fertility a high rent; but it is one thing to be able to bear a high rent, and another thing actually to pay it. Rent may be lower in a country where lands are exceedingly fertile than in a country where they yield a moderate return, it being in proportion rather to relative than absolute fertilityâ€”to the value of the produce, and not to its abundance. Mr. Malthus says, that the &quot;cause of the excess of price of the necessaries of life above the cost of production, is to be found in their abundance rather than their scarcity, and is essentially different from the high price of those peculiar products of the earth, not connected with food, which may be called natural and necessary monopolies.&quot;</div><div class="paragraph">In what are they essentially different? Would not the abundance of those peculiar products of the earth cause a rise of rent, if the demand for them at the same time increased? and can rent ever rise, whatever the commodity produced may be, from abundance merely, and without an increase of demand?</div><div class="paragraph"><a>560</a>The second cause of rent mentioned by Mr. Malthus, namely, &quot;that quality peculiar to the necessaries of life, of being able to create their own demand, or to raise up a number of demanders in proportion to the quantity of necessaries produced,&quot; does not appear to me to be any way essential to it. It is not the abundance of necessaries which raises up demanders, but the abundance of demanders which raises up necessaries.</div><div class="paragraph">We are under no necessity of producing permanently any greater quantity of a commodity than that which is demanded. If by accident any greater quantity were produced, it would fall below its natural price, and therefore would not pay the cost of production, together with the usual and ordinary profits of stock: thus the supply would be checked till it conformed to the demand, and the market price rose to the natural price.</div><div class="paragraph">Mr. Malthus appears to me to be too much inclined to think that population is only increased by the previous provision of food,â€”&quot;that it is food that creates its own demand,&quot;â€”that it is by first providing food that<a>561</a>Â encouragement is given to marriage, instead of considering that the general progress of population is affected by the increase of capital, the consequent demand for labour, and the rise of wages; and that the production of food is but the effect of that demand.</div><div class="paragraph">It is by giving the workman more money, or any other commodity in which wages are paid, and which has not fallen in value, that his situation is improved. The increase of population, and the increase of food will generally be the effect, but not the necessary effect of high wages. The amended condition of the labourer, in consequence of the increased value which is paid him, does not necessarily oblige him to marry and take upon himself the charge of a familyâ€”he may, if it please him, exchange his increased wages for any commodities that may contribute to his enjoymentsâ€”for chairs, tables, and hardware; or for better clothes, sugar, and tobacco. His increased wages then will be attended with no other effect than an increased demand for some of those commodities; and as the race of labourers will not be materially increased, his wages will continue permanent<a>562</a>ly high. But although this might be the consequence of high wages, yet so great are the delights of domestic society, that in practice it is invariably found that an increase of population follows the amended condition of the labourer; and it is only because it does so, that a new and increased demand arises for food. This demand then is the effect of an increase of population, but not the causeâ€”it is only because the expenditure of the people takes this direction, that the market price of necessaries exceeds the natural price, and that the quantity of food required is produced; and it is because the number of people is increased, that wages again fall.</div><div class="paragraph">What motive can a farmer have to produce more corn than is actually demanded, when the consequence would be a depression of its market price below its natural price, and consequently a privation to him of a portion of his profits, by reducing them below the general rate? &quot;If,&quot; says Mr. Malthus, &quot;the necessaries of life, the most important products of land, had not the property of creating an increase of demand proportioned to their increased quantity, such increased quan<a>563</a>tity would occasion a fall in their exchangeable value.<a></a><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/33310/33310-h/33310-h.htm#Footnote_52">52</a>Â However abundant might be the produce of a country, its population might remain stationary. And this abundance without a proportionate demand, and with a very high corn price of labour, which would naturally take place under these circumstances, might reduce the price of raw produce, like the price of manufactures, to the cost of production.&quot;</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;Might reduce the price of raw produce to the cost of production?&quot; Is it ever for any length of time either above or below this price? Does not Mr. Malthus himself, state it never to be so? &quot;I hope,&quot; he says, &quot;to be excused for dwelling a little, and presenting to the reader in various forms the doctrine, that corn, in reference to the quantityÂ actually produced, is sold at its necessary price like manufactures, because I consider it as a truth of the highest importance, which has been overlooked by the economists, by AdamÂ <a>564</a>Smith, and all those writers, who have represented raw produce as selling always at a monopoly price.&quot;</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;Every extensive country may thus be considered as possessing a gradation of machines for the production of corn and raw materials, including in this gradation not only all the various qualities of poor land, of which every territory has generally an abundance, but the inferior machinery which may be said to be employed when good land is further and further forced for additional produce. As the price of raw produce continues to rise, these inferior machines are successively called into action; and as the price of raw produce continues to fall, they are successively thrown out of action. The illustration here used serves to shew at once theÂ necessity of the actual price of corn to the actual produce, and the different effect which would attend a great reduction in the price of any particular manufacture, and a great reduction in the price of raw produce.&quot;<a></a><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/33310/33310-h/33310-h.htm#Footnote_53">53</a></div><div class="paragraph"><a>565</a></div><div class="paragraph">How are these passages to be reconciled to that which affirms, that if the necessaries of life had not the property of creating an increase of demand proportioned to their increased quantity, the abundant quantity produced would then, and then only, reduce the price of raw produce to the cost of production? If corn is never under its natural price, it is never more abundant than the actual population require it to be for their own consumption; no store can be laid up for theÂ <a>566</a>consumption of others; it can never then by its cheapness and abundance be a stimulus to population. In proportion as corn can be produced cheaply, the increased wages of the labourers will have more power to maintain families. In America, population increases rapidly, because food can be produced at a cheap price, and not because an abundant supply has been previously provided. In Europe population increases comparatively slowly, because food cannot be produced at a cheap value. In the usual and ordinary course of things, the demand for all commodities precedes their supply. By saying, that corn would, like manufactures, sink to its price of production, if it could not raise up demanders, Mr. Malthus cannot mean that all rent would be absorbed; for he has himself justly remarked, that if all rent were given up by the landlords, corn would not fall in price; rent being the effect, and not the cause of high price, and there being always one quality of land in cultivation which pays no rent whatever, the corn from which replaces by its price, only wages and profits.</div><div class="paragraph">In the following passage, Mr. Malthus has<a>567</a>Â given an able exposition of the causes of the rise in the price of raw produce in rich and progressive countries, in every word of which I concur; but it appears to me to be at variance with some of the propositions maintained by him in some parts of his Essay on Rent. &quot;I have no hesitation in stating, that, independently of the irregularities in the currency of a country, and other temporary and accidental circumstances, the cause of the high comparative money price of corn is its high comparativeÂ real price, or the greater quantity of capital and labour which must be employed to produce it; and that the reasons why the real price of corn is higher, and continually rising in countries which are already rich, and still advancing in prosperity and population, is to be found in the necessity of resorting constantly to poorer land, to machines which require a greater expenditure to work them, and which consequently occasion each fresh addition to the raw produce of the country to be purchased at a greater cost; in short, it is to be found in the important truth, that corn in a progressive country, is sold at the price necessary to yield the actual supply;<a>568</a>Â and that, as this supply becomes more and more difficult, the price rises in proportion.&quot;</div><div class="paragraph">The real price of a commodity is here properly stated to depend on the greater or less quantity of labour and capital (that is, accumulated labour) which must be employed to produce it. Real price does not, as some have contended, depend on money value; nor, as others have said, on value relatively to corn, labour, or any other commodity taken singly, or to all commodities collectively; but, as Mr. Malthus justly says, &quot;on the greater (or less) quantity of capital and labour which must be employed to produce it.&quot;</div><div class="paragraph">Among the causes of the rise of rent, Mr. Malthus mentions, &quot;such an increase of population as will lower the wages of labour.&quot; But if, as the wages of labour fall, the profits of stock rise, and they be together always of the same value,<a></a><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/33310/33310-h/33310-h.htm#Footnote_54">54</a>Â no fall of wages can raise rent, for it will neither diminish the portion, nor the value of the portion of the pro<a>569</a>duce which will be allotted to the farmer and labourer together, and therefore will not leave a larger portion, nor a larger value for the landlord. In proportion as less is appropriated for wages, more will be appropriated for profits, andÂ vice versa. This division will be settled by the farmer and his labourers, without any interference of the landlord; and indeed it is a matter in which he can have no interest, otherwise than as one division may be more favourable than another, to new accumulations, and to a further demand for land. If wages fall, profits, and not rent, would rise. If wages rose, profits, and not rent, would fall. The rise of rent and wages, and the fall of profits, are generally the inevitable effects of the same causeâ€”the increasing demand for food, the increased quantity of labour required to produce it, and its consequently high price. If the landlord were to forego his whole rent, the labourers would not be in the least benefited. If the labourers were to give up their whole wages, the landlords would derive no advantage from such a circumstance; but in both cases the farmer would receive and retain all which they relinquished. It has been my endeavour to<a>570</a>Â shew in this work, that a fall of wages would have no other effect than to raise profits.</div><div class="paragraph">Another cause of the rise of rent, according to Mr. Malthus, is &quot;such agricultural improvements, or such increase of exertions, as will diminish the number of labourers necessary to produce a given effect.&quot; This would not raise the value of the whole produce, and would therefore not increase rent. It would rather have a contrary tendency, it would lower rent; for if in consequence of these improvements, the actual quantity of food required could be furnished either with fewer hands, or with a less quantity of land, the price of raw produce would fall, and capital would be withdrawn from the land.<a></a><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/33310/33310-h/33310-h.htm#Footnote_55">55</a>Â Nothing can raise rent, but a demand for new land of an inferior quality, or some cause which shall occasion an alteration in the relative fertility of the land already under cultivation.<a></a><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/33310/33310-h/33310-h.htm#Footnote_56">567</a>Â ImprovementsÂ <a>571</a>in agriculture, and in the division of labour, are common to all land; they increase the absolute quantity of raw produce obtained from each, but probably do not much disturb the relative proportions which before existed between them.</div><div class="paragraph">Mr. Malthus has justly commented on an error of Adam Smith, and says, &quot;the substance of his (Dr. Smith&#x27;s) argument is, that corn is of so peculiar a nature, that its real price cannot be raised by an increase of its money price; and that, as it is clearly an increase of real price alone, which can encourage its production, the rise of money price, occasioned by a bounty, can have no such effect.&quot;</div><div class="paragraph">He continues: &quot;It is by no means intended to deny the powerful influence of the price of corn upon the price of labour, on an average of a considerable number of years; but that this influence is not such as to prevent the movement of capital to, or from the land,Â <a>572</a>which is the precise point in question, will be made sufficiently evident by a short inquiry into the manner in which labour is paid, and brought into the market, and by a consideration of the consequences to which the assumption of Adam Smith&#x27;s proposition would inevitably lead.&quot;<a></a><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/33310/33310-h/33310-h.htm#Footnote_57">57</a></div><div class="paragraph">Mr. Malthus then proceeds to shew, that demand and high price will as effectually encourage the production of raw produce, as the demand and high price of any other commodity will encourage its production. In this view it will be seen, from what I have said of the effects of bounties, that I entirely concur. I have noticed the passage Mr. Malthus&#x27;s &quot;Observations on the Corn Laws,&quot; for the purpose of shewing in what a different sense the term real price is used here, and in his other pamphlet, entitled &quot;Grounds of an Opinion, &amp;c.&quot; In this passage Mr. Malthus tells us, that &quot;it is clearly an increase of real price alone which can encourage the production of corn,&quot; and by real price he evidently means the increase in its value relatively to all otherÂ <a>573</a>things, or in other words, the rise in its market above its natural price, or the cost of its production. If by real price this is what is meant, Mr. Malthus&#x27;s opinion is undoubtedly correct; it is the rise in the market price of corn which alone encourages its production, for it may be laid down as a principle uniformly true, that the only encouragement to the increased production of a commodity, is its market value exceeding its natural or necessary value.</div><div class="paragraph">But this is not the meaning which Mr. Malthus, on other occasions, attaches to the term, real price. In the Essay on Rent, Mr. Malthus says, by &quot;the real growing price of corn, I mean the realÂ quantityÂ of labour and capital,Â which has been employedÂ to produce the last additions which have been made to the national produce.&quot; In another part he states &quot;the cause of the high comparative real price of corn to be the greaterÂ quantityÂ of capital and labour, which must beÂ employedÂ to produce it.&quot;<a></a><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/33310/33310-h/33310-h.htm#Footnote_58">58</a>Â Suppose that in the fore<a>574</a>going passage we were to substitute this definition of real price, would it not then run thus?â€”&quot;It is clearly the increase in the quantity of labour and capital which must be employed to produce corn, which alone can encourage its production.&quot; This would be to say, that it is clearly the rise in the natural or necessary price of corn, which encourages its productionâ€”a proposition which could not be maintained. It is not the price at which corn can be produced, that has any influence on the quantity produced, but the price at which it can be sold. It is in proportion to the degree of the excess of its price above the cost of production, that capital is attracted to or repelled from the land. If that excess be such as to give to capital so employed, a greater than the general profit of stock, capital will go to the land; if less, it will be withdrawn from it.</div><div class="paragraph"><a>575</a></div><div class="paragraph">It is not then by an alteration in the real price of corn that its production is encouraged, but by an alteration in its market price. It is not &quot;because a greater quantity of capital and labour must be employed to produce it,&quot; Mr. Malthus&#x27;s just definition of real price, that more capital and labour are attracted to the land, but because the market price rises above this its real price, and, notwithstanding the increased charge, makes the cultivation of land the more profitable employment of capital.</div><div class="paragraph">Nothing can be more just than the following observations of Mr. Malthus, on Adam Smith&#x27;s standard of value. &quot;Adam Smith was evidently led into this train of argument, from his habit of consideringÂ labour as the standard measure of value, and corn as the measure of labour. But that corn is a very inaccurate measure of labour, the history of our own country will amply demonstrate; where labour, compared with corn, will be found to have experienced very great and striking variations, not only from year to year, but from century to century; and for ten, twenty, and thirty years together.Â And<a>576</a>Â that neither labour nor any other commodity can be an accurate measure of real value in exchange, is now considered as one of the most incontrovertible doctrines of political economy; and, indeed, follows from the very definition of value in exchange.&quot;</div><div class="paragraph">If neither corn nor labour are accurate measures of real value in exchange, which they clearly are not, what other commodity is?â€”certainly none. If then the expression real price of commodities, have any meaning, it must be that which Mr. Malthus has stated, in the Essay on Rentâ€”it must be measured by the proportionate quantity of capital and labour necessary to produce them.</div><div class="paragraph">In Mr. Malthus&#x27;s &quot;Inquiry into the Nature of Rent,&quot; he says, &quot;that, independently of irregularities in the currency of a country, and other temporary and accidental circumstances, the cause of the high comparative money price of corn, is its high comparative real price,Â or the greater quantity of capital and labour which must be employed to produce it.<a></a><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/33310/33310-h/33310-h.htm#Footnote_59">59</a></div><div class="paragraph">This, I apprehend, is the correct account of all permanent variations in price, whether of corn or of any other commodity. A commodity can only permanently rise in price, either because a greater quantity of capital and labour must be employed to produce it, or because money has fallen in value; and on the contrary, it can only fall in price, either because a less quantity of capital and labour may be employed to produce it, or because money has risen in value.</div><div class="paragraph">A variation arising from the latter of either of these alternatives, an altered value of money, is common at once to all commodities; but a variation arising from the former cause, is confined to the particular commodity requiring more or less labour in its production. By allowing the free importation of corn, or by improvements in agriculture, raw produce would fall; but the price of no other commodity would be affected, except in proportion to the fall in the real value, or cost of production, of the raw produce which entered into its composition.</div><div class="paragraph">Mr. Malthus, having acknowledged this<a>578</a>Â principle, cannot, I think, consistently maintain that the whole money value of all the commodities in the country must sink exactly in proportion to the fall in the price of corn. If the corn consumed in the country were of the value of ten millions per annum, and the manufactured and foreign commodities consumed were of the value of twenty millions, making altogether thirty millions, it would not be admissible to infer that the annual expenditure was reduced to 15 millions, because corn had fallen 50 per cent., or from 10 to 5 millions.</div><div class="paragraph">The value of the raw produce which entered into the composition of these manufactures might not, for example, exceed 20 per cent. of their whole value, and, therefore, the fall in the value of manufactured commodities, instead of being from 20 to 10 millions, would be only from 20 to 18 millions; and after the fall in the price of corn of 50 per cent., the whole amount of the annual expenditure, instead of falling from 30 to 25 millions, would fall from 30 to 23 millions.<a></a><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/33310/33310-h/33310-h.htm#Footnote_60">60</a></div><div class="paragraph"><a>579</a>Instead of thus considering the effect of a fall in the value of raw produce; as Mr. Malthus was bound to do by his previous admission; he considers it as precisely the same thing with a rise of 100 per cent. in the value of money, and, therefore, argues as if all commodities would sink to half their former price.</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;During the twenty years, beginning with 1794,&quot; he says, &quot;and ending with 1813, the average price of British corn per quarter was about eighty-three shillings; during the ten years ending with 1813, ninety-two shillings; and during the last five years of the twenty, one hundred and eight shillings. In the course of these twenty years, the Government borrowed near five hundred millions of real capital; for which, on a rough average, exclusive of the sinking fund, it engaged to pay about five per cent. But if corn shouldÂ <a>580</a>fall to fifty shillings a quarter, and other commodities in proportion, instead of an interest of about five per cent., the Government would really pay an interest of seven, eight, nine, and, for the last two hundred millions, ten per cent.</div><div class="paragraph">&quot;To this extraordinary generosity towards the stockholders, I should be disposed to make no kind of objection, if it were not necessary to consider by whom it is to be paid; and a moment&#x27;s reflection will shew us, that it can only be paid by the industrious classes of society, and the landlords, that is, by all those whose nominal income will vary with the variations in the measure of value. The nominal revenues of this part of the society, compared with the average of the last five years, will be diminished one half, and out of this nominally reduced income, they will have to pay the same nominal amount of taxes.&quot;<a></a><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/33310/33310-h/33310-h.htm#Footnote_61">61</a></div><div class="paragraph">In the first place, I think, I have already shewn, that the nominal income of the wholeÂ <a>581</a>country will not be diminished in the proportion for which Mr. Malthus here contends; it would not follow, that because corn fell fifty per cent., each man&#x27;s income would be reduced fifty per cent. in value.<a></a><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/33310/33310-h/33310-h.htm#Footnote_62">62</a></div><div class="paragraph">In the second place, I think the reader will agree with me, that the increased charge, if admitted, would not fall exclusively &quot;on the landlords and the industrious classes of society:&quot; the stockholder, by his expenditure, contributes his share to the support of the public burdens in the same way as the other classes of society. If then money became really more valuable, although he would receive a greater value, he would also pay a greater value in taxes, and, therefore, it cannot be true that the whole addition to the real value of the interest would be paid by &quot;the landlords and the industrious classes.&quot;</div><div class="paragraph">The whole argument, however, of Mr. Malthus, is built on an infirm basis: it supposes,<a>582</a>Â because the gross income of the country is diminished, that, therefore, the net income must also be diminished, in the same proportion. It has been one of the objects of this work to shew, that with every fall in the real value of necessaries, the wages of labour would fall, and that the profits of stock would riseâ€”in other words, that of any given annual value a less portion would be paid to the labouring class, and a larger portion to those whose funds employed this class. Suppose the value of the commodities produced in a particular manufacture to be 1000l., and to be divided between the master and his labourers, in the proportion of 800l.Â to labourers, and 200l.Â to the master; if the value of these commodities should fall to 900l., and 100l.Â be saved from the wages of labour, in consequence of the fall of necessaries, the net income of the masters would be in no degree impaired, and, therefore, he could with just as much facility pay the same amount of taxes, after, as before the reduction of price.<a></a><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/33310/33310-h/33310-h.htm#Footnote_63">63</a></div><div class="paragraph"><a>583</a></div><div class="paragraph">And that wages would fall as much as the mass of commodities, or rather that the net income remaining to landlords, farmers, manufacturers, traders, and stockholders, the only real payers of taxes, would be as great as before, is very highly probable; for nothing would be even nominally lost to the society by the freest importation of corn, but that portion of rent of which the landlords would be deprived in consequence of the fall of raw produce.</div><div class="paragraph">The difference between the value of corn and all other commodities sold in the country, before and after the importation of cheap corn, would be only equal to the fall of rent; because, independently of rent, the same quantity of labour would always produce the same value.</div><div class="paragraph">The whole reduction which is made in wages, is a value actually added to the value of the net income before possessed by the society; whilst the only value which is taken from that net income is the value of that part of their rent of which the landlords will be deprived by a fall of raw produce. When we<a>584</a>Â consider that the fall of produce acts upon a limited number of landlords, while it reduces the wages not only of those who are employed in agriculture, but of all those who are occupied in manufactures and commerce, it may well be doubted, whether the net revenue of the society would suffer any abatement whatever.<a></a><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/33310/33310-h/33310-h.htm#Footnote_64">64</a></div><div class="paragraph">But, if it did, it must not be supposed that the ability to pay taxes will diminish in the same degree, as the money value, even of the net revenue. Suppose that my net revenue were diminished from 1000l.Â to 900l.; but that my taxes continued to be the same, to be 100l.: is it not probable that my ability to pay this 100l.Â may be greater with the smaller than with the larger revenue? Commodities cannot fall so universally as Mr. Malthus supposes, without greatly benefiting the consumers, without enabling them with aÂ <a>585</a>much smaller money revenue to command more of the conveniences, necessaries, and luxuries of human life; and the question resolves itself into thisâ€”whether those who are in possession of the net revenue of the country will be benefited as much by the diminished price of commodities, as they will suffer by the greater real taxation. On which side the balance may preponderate, will depend on the proportion which taxes bear to the annual revenue; if it be enormously large, it may undoubtedly more than counterbalance the advantages from cheap necessaries; but I trust enough has been said, to shew, that Mr. Malthus has very greatly over-rated the loss to the tax-payers, from a fall in one of the most important necessaries of life; and that if they were not entirely remunerated for the real increase of taxes, by the fall of wages and increase of profits, they would be more than compensated, by the cheaper price of all objects on which their incomes were expended.</div><div class="paragraph">That the stockholder is benefited by a great fall in the value of corn, cannot be doubted; but if no one else be injured, that is no reason<a>586</a>Â why corn should be made dear: for the gains of the stockholder are national gains, and increase, as all other gains do, the real wealth and power of the country. If they are unjustly benefited, let the degree in which they are so, be accurately ascertained, and then it is for the legislature to devise a remedy; but no policy can be more unwise than to shut ourselves out from the great advantages arising from cheap corn, and abundant productions, merely because the stockholder would have an undue proportion of the increase.</div><div class="paragraph">To regulate the dividends on stock by the money value of corn, has never yet been attempted. If justice and good faith required such a regulation, a great debt is due to the old stockholders; for they have been receiving the same money dividends for more than a century, although corn has, perhaps, been doubled or trebled in price.<a></a><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/33310/33310-h/33310-h.htm#Footnote_65">65</a></div><div class="paragraph"><a>587</a></div><div class="paragraph">Mr. Malthus says, &quot;It is true, that the last additions to the agricultural produce of an improving country are not attended with a large proportion of rent; and it is precisely this circumstance that may make it answer to a rich country to import some of its corn, if it can be secure of obtaining an equable supply. But in all cases the importation of foreign corn must fail to answer nationally, if it is not so much cheaper than the corn that can be grown at home, as to equal both the profits and the rent of the grain which it displaces.&quot;Â Grounds, &amp;c. p. 36.</div><div class="paragraph">As rent is the effect of the high price of corn, the loss of rent is the effect of a low price. Foreign corn never enters into competition with such home corn as affords a rent; the fall of price invariably affects the landlord till the whole of his rent is absorbed;â€”if it fall still more, the price will not afford even the common profits of stock; capital will then quit the land for some other employment, and the corn, which was before grown upon it, will then, and not till then, be imported. From the loss of rent, there will be a loss of value, of estimated money value, but there will be<a>588</a>Â a gain of wealth. The amount of the raw produce and other productions together will be increased, from the greater facility with which they are produced; they will, though augmented in quantity, be diminished in value.</div><div class="paragraph">Two men employ equal capitalsâ€”one in agriculture, the other in manufactures. That in agriculture produces a net annual value of 1200l.Â of which 1000l.Â is retained for profit, and 200l.Â is paid for rent; the other in manufactures produces only an annual value of 1000l.Â Suppose that by importation, the same quantity of corn can be obtained for commodities which cost 950l., and that, in consequence, the capital employed in agriculture is diverted to manufactures, where it can produce a value of 1000l.Â the net revenue of the country will be of less value, it will be reduced from 2200l.Â to 2000l., but there will not only be the same quantity of commodities and corn for its own consumption, but also as much addition to that quantity as 50l.Â would purchase, the difference between the value at which its manufactures were sold to the foreign country, and the value of the corn which was purchased from it.</div><div class="paragraph"><a>589</a>Mr. Malthus says, &quot;It has been justly observed by Adam Smith, that no equal quantity of productive labour employed in manufactures can ever occasion so great a reproduction as in agriculture.&quot; If Adam Smith speaks of value, he is correct, but if he speaks of riches, which is the important point, he is mistaken, for he has himself defined riches to consist of the necessaries, conveniences, and enjoyments of human life. One set of necessaries and conveniences admits of no comparison with another set; value in use cannot be measured by any known standard, it is differently estimated by different persons.</div><div class="paragraph">Chap. xv. part i. &quot;Des DÃ©bouchÃ©s,&quot; contains in particular some very important principles, which I believe were first explained by this distinguished writer.</div><div class="paragraph"><a></a><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/33310/33310-h/33310-h.htm#FNanchor_2">[2]</a>Book i. chap. 5.</div><div class="paragraph"><a></a><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/33310/33310-h/33310-h.htm#FNanchor_3">[3]</a>&quot;But though labour be the real measure of the exchangeable value of all commodities, it is not that by which their value is commonly estimated. It is often difficult to ascertain the proportion between two different quantities of labour. The time spent in two different sorts of work will not always alone determine this proportion. The different degrees of hardship endured, and of ingenuity exercised, must likewise be taken into account. There may be more labour in an hour&#x27;s hard work, than in two hours&#x27; easy business; or, in an hour&#x27;s application to a trade, which it costs ten years&#x27; labour to learn, than in a month&#x27;s industry at an ordinary and obvious employment. But it is not easy to find any accurate measure, either of hardship or ingenuity. In exchanging, indeed, the different productions of different sorts of labour for one another, some allowance is commonly made for both. It is adjusted, however, not by any accurate measure, but by the higgling and bargaining of the market, according to that sort of rough equality, which, though not exact, is sufficient for carrying on the business of common life.&quot;â€”Wealth of Nations.Â Book i. chap. 10.</div><div class="paragraph"><a></a><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/33310/33310-h/33310-h.htm#FNanchor_4">[4]</a>Wealth of Nations, book i. chap. 10.</div><div class="paragraph"><a></a><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/33310/33310-h/33310-h.htm#FNanchor_5">[5]</a>&quot;The earth, as we have already seen, is not the only agent of nature which has a productive power; but it is the only one, or nearly so, that one set of men take to themselves, to the exclusion of others; and of which consequently they can appropriate the benefits.

Besides it is not observed that corn is more dear in those places where there is plenty of uncultivated land, than in completely cultivated countries. England and France were much more imperfectly cultivated in the middle ages than they are now; they produced much less raw produce: nevertheless from all that we can judge by a comparison with the value of other things, corn was not sold at a dearer price.

In proportion as she becomes niggardly in her gifts, she exacts a greater price for her work. Where she is munificently beneficent, she always works gratis. &quot;The labouring cattle employed in agriculture, not only occasion, like the workmen in manufactures, the reproduction of a value equal to their own consumption, or to the capital which employs them, together with its owner&#x27;s profits, but of a much greater value. Over and above the capital of the farmer and all its profits, they regularly occasion the reproduction of the rent of the landlord. This rent may be considered as the produce of those powers of nature, the use of which the landlord lends to the farmer. It is greater or smaller according to the supposed extent of those powers, or in other words, according to the supposed natural or improved fertility of the land. It is the work of nature which remains, after deducting or compensating every thing which can be regarded as the work of man. It is seldom less than a fourth, and frequently more than a third of the whole produce. No equal quantity of productive labour employed in manufactures, can ever occasion so great a reproduction.Â In them nature does nothing, man does all; and the reproduction must always be in proportion to the strength of the agents that occasion it. The capital employed in agriculture, therefore, not only puts into motion a greater quantity of productive labour than any equal capital employed in manufactures, but in proportion too to the quantity of the productive labour which it employs, it adds a much greater value to the annual produce of the land and labour of the country, to theÂ realÂ wealth and revenue of its inhabitants. Of all the ways in which a capital can be employed, it is by far the most advantageous to the society.&quot;â€”Book II. chap. v. p. 15.</div><div class="paragraph">Does nature nothing for man in manufactures? Are the powers of wind and water, which move our machinery, and assist navigation, nothing? The pressure of the atmosphere and the elasticity of steam, which enable us to work the most stupendous enginesâ€”are they not the gifts of nature? to say nothing of the effects of the matter of heat in softening and melting metals, of the decomposition of the atmosphere in the process of dyeing and fermentation. There is not a manufacture which can be mentioned, in which nature does not give her assistance to man, and give it too, generously and gratuitously.</div><div class="paragraph">In remarking on the passage which I have copied from Adam Smith, Mr. Buchanan observes, &quot;I have endeavoured to shew, in the observations on productive and unproductive labour, contained in the fourth volume, that agriculture adds no more to the national stock than any other sort of industry. In dwelling on the reproduction of rent as so great an advantage to society, Dr. Smith does not reflect that rent is the effect of high price, and that what the landlord gains in this way, he gains at the expense of the community at large. There is no absolute gain to the society by the reproduction of rent; it is only one class profiting at the expense of another class. The notion of agriculture yielding a produce, and a rent in consequence, because nature concurs with human industry in the process of cultivation, is a mere fancy.

The surplus part of them, therefore, must be sent abroad, and exchanged for something for which there is a demand at home. It is only by means of such exportation, that this surplus can acquire a value sufficient to compensate the labour and expense of producing it.&quot; One would be led to think by the above passage, that Adam Smith concluded we were under some necessity of producing a surplus of corn, woollen goods, and hardware, and that the capital which produced them could not be otherwise employed. It is, however, always a matter of choice in what way a capital shall be employed, and therefore there can never, for any length of time, be a surplus of any commodity; for if there were, it would fall below its natural price, and capital would be removed to some more profitable employment.

Say, &quot;are attended with the inconvenience of withdrawing capital, or portions of capital, from productive employments, to devote them to consumption; and when they take place in a country,Â the Government of which does not inspire much confidence, they have the further inconvenience of raising the interest of capital. Who would lend at 5 per cent. per annum to agriculture, to manufacturers, and to commerce, when a borrower may be found ready to pay an interest of 7 or 8 per cent.? That sort of income, which is called profit of stock, would rise then at the expense of the consumer. Consumption would be reduced by the rise in the price of produce; and the other productive services would be less in demand, less well paid. The whole nation, capitalists excepted, would be the sufferers from such a state of things.&quot; To the question: &quot;who would lend money to farmers, manufacturers, and merchants, at 5 per cent. per annum, when another borrower having little credit, would give 7 or 8?&quot; I reply, that every prudent and reasonable man would. Because the rate of interest is 7 or 8 per cent. there where the lender runs extraordinary risk, is this any reason that it should be equally high in those places where they are secured from such risks? M. Say allows, that the rate of interest depends on the rate of profits; but it does not therefore follow, that the rate of profits depends on the rate of interest.

The corn bounty, it is to be observed, as well as every other bounty upon exportation, imposes two different taxes upon the people; first, the tax which they are obliged to contribute, in order to pay the bounty; and, secondly, the tax which arises from the advanced price of the commodity in the home market, and which, as the whole body of the people are purchasers of corn, must in this particular commodity be paid by the whole body of the people. In this particular commodity, therefore, this second tax is by much the heaviest of the two.&quot; &quot;For every five shillings, therefore, which they contribute to the payment of the first tax, they must contribute six pounds four shillings to the payment of the second.&quot; &quot;The extraordinary exportation of corn, therefore, occasioned by the bounty, not only in every particular year diminishes the home, just as much as it extends the foreign market and consumption, but, by restraining the population and industry of the country, its final tendency is to stunt and restrain the gradual extension of the home market, and thereby, in the long run, rather to diminish than to augment the whole market and consumption of corn.&quot;</div><div class="paragraph"><a></a><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/33310/33310-h/33310-h.htm#FNanchor_37">[37]</a>The same opinion is held by M.

Every diminution of price, not fully and immediately balanced by a proportioned fall in all the necessary expenses of a farm, every tax on the land, every tax on farming stock, every tax on the necessaries of farmers, will tell in the computation; and if, after all these outgoings are allowed for, the price of the produce will not leave a fair remuneration for the capital employed, according to the general rate of profits, and a rent at least equal to the rent of the land in its former state, no sufficient motive can exist to undertake the projected improvement.&quot; Observations, p. 22.</div><div class="paragraph"><a></a><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/33310/33310-h/33310-h.htm#FNanchor_54">[54]</a>See p. 124.</div><div class="paragraph"><a></a><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/33310/33310-h/33310-h.htm#FNanchor_55">[55]</a>See p. 70, &amp;c.</div><div class="paragraph"><a></a><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/33310/33310-h/33310-h.htm#FNanchor_56">[56]</a>It is not necessary to state on every occasion, but it must be always understood, that the same effect will be produced by employing different, but equal portions of capital on the land already in cultivation, with different results.
